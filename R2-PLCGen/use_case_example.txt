### Use Case Design

**Instructions:** Fill in the bracketed placeholders `[Your ... here]` with the specific details for your system. Do NOT change the section headings, numbering, or item identifiers (e.g., `[UC-1]:`, `[B-1]:`, `(1)`).

1.  Use Case Name:
    [Your System/Project Name for which these use cases are being designed]

2.  Actors:
    [Actor 1 Name - e.g., User, Administrator, External System]
    [Actor 2 Name]
    [Actor N Name - List all primary entities (human or system) that interact with the system]

3.  Use Cases:
    [UC-1]: [Name of Use Case 1] 每 [Brief, one-sentence description of Use Case 1]
    [UC-2]: [Name of Use Case 2] 每 [Brief, one-sentence description of Use Case 2]
    [UC-3]: [Name of Use Case 3] 每 [Brief, one-sentence description of Use Case 3]
    [UC-N]: [Name of Use Case N] 每 [Brief, one-sentence description of Use Case N]
    (Continue for all identified use cases, maintaining the [UC-X]: format)

4.  System Boundary:
    [Define what is considered part of the system being designed and what is external. E.g., "The core [System Name] application, excluding external payment gateways."]

5.  Relationships Among Actors:
    [Describe how the actors interact with each other and with the system's use cases.
    Example: "[Actor 1] initiates [UC-X] by [action]. [Actor 2] is notified when [UC-Y] is completed.
    Detail any overrides, dependencies, or sequences of actor interactions related to the use cases.]

6.  Detailed Descriptive Information for Each Use Case:

    (Repeat the following structure for each Use Case identified in section 3)

    Use Case: [UC-Identifier from section 3, e.g., UC-1] [Name of Use Case from section 3]
    (1) Brief Description:
        [A slightly more detailed (1-3 sentences) description of this specific use case's purpose and main goal. This might be the same as in section 3 or slightly expanded.]
    (2) Preconditions:
        每 [Condition 1 that must be true before this use case can start]
        每 [Condition 2 that must be true before this use case can start]
        每 [List all necessary preconditions]
    (3) Event Flow:
        Basic Flow:
          1. [First step the actor/system takes in the normal, successful path]
          2. [Second step...]
          3. [Continue detailing the sequence of events for the typical success scenario]
          N. [Final step in the basic flow]
        Alternative Flow(s):
          每 AF-1: [Name of Alternative Flow 1, e.g., "User cancels operation"]**
            1. [Condition that triggers this alternative flow, e.g., "At step X of Basic Flow, if..."]
            2. [Steps for this alternative path]
          每 AF-2: [Name of Alternative Flow 2, e.g., "System error occurs"]**
            1. [Condition that triggers this alternative flow]
            2. [Steps for this alternative path]
          (List all significant alternative paths, error conditions, or exceptions)
    (4) Post Conditions:
        Success:
        每 [Condition 1 that is true if the use case completes successfully]
        每 [Condition 2 that is true if the use case completes successfully]
        Failure (if applicable):
        每 [Condition 1 that is true if the use case fails or is terminated]
    (5) Special Requirements:
        每 [List any non-functional requirements, constraints, business rules, performance criteria, security considerations, etc., specific to THIS use case]

    (End of repeated structure for a single use case. Repeat for UC-2, UC-3, ..., UC-N)

7.  Priority of Use Cases:
    [UC-Identifier from section 3, e.g., UC-1 Name of Use Case 1]: [Priority Level (e.g., High, Medium, Low) - Optionally add a brief justification]
    [UC-Identifier from section 3, e.g., UC-2 Name of Use Case 2]: [Priority Level]
    [UC-Identifier from section 3, e.g., UC-N Name of Use Case N]: [Priority Level]
    (List all use cases and their relative priorities)

8.  Data Requirements:
    [D-1]: [Description of data element 1 essential for the system/use cases. Include source, format, or significance if relevant.]
    [D-2]: [Description of data element 2]
    [D-N]: [Description of data element N]
    (List all significant data elements the system needs to process, store, or generate)

9.  Business Rules:
    [B-1]: [Statement of overarching business rule 1 that governs system behavior across multiple use cases or defines a core policy.]
    [B-2]: [Statement of business rule 2]
    [B-N]: [Statement of business rule N]
    (List all key business rules that are not specific to a single use case but apply more broadly to the system's operation)
