RU1. The use case description must mention at least one actor and one use case.
RU2. Any interaction mentioned in the use case description (e.g., associations between actors and use cases) must explicitly involve two defined actors or use cases.

    Postconditions (system state after execution).
RU8. The use case description must explicitly document:
    Inputs (data/events from actors).
    Outputs (data/actions to actors).
    Trigger events (e.g., "user clicks Submit").
    System boundary (distinguish internal/external elements).
