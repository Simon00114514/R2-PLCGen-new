   - CTL Expression: `AG (car_on_conveyor_system AND spray_system_ready)`

2. **Basic Flow:**
   - The operator presses the conveyor system button to move the car to the spray station.
   - CTL Expression: `AG (operator_presses_conveyor_button -> AF car_at_spray_station)`

   - The operator presses the spray button, and the spray system sprays the car for 3 seconds.
   - CTL Expression: `AG (operator_presses_spray_button -> AF (spray_system_spraying AND EF[3] spray_system_stops))`

   - The spray button resets, and the conveyor system restarts to move the car away.
   - CTL Expression: `AG (spray_system_stops -> AF (spray_button_resets AND conveyor_system_restarts))`

3. **Alternative Flow:**
   - If the conveyor stop button is pressed while the car is detected by the sensor, the conveyor system stops.
   - CTL Expression: `AG (conveyor_stop_button_pressed AND car_detected_by_sensor -> AF conveyor_system_stops)`

4. **Post Conditions:**
   - Success: The car has been sprayed, the spray button is reset, and the car is moved away from the spray station.
   - CTL Expression: `AG (car_sprayed AND spray_button_reset AND car_moved_away)`
