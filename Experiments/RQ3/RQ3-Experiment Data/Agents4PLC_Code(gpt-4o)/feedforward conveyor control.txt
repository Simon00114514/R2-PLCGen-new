Agent: Here is a sample PLC ST code that implements the feedforward control based on sensor-predicted load to adjust the conveyor belt speed:

```plc
PROGRAM ConveyorControl
VAR
    CurrentLoad : REAL;
    ThresholdLoad : REAL;
    CurrentSpeed : REAL;
    DesiredSpeed : REAL;
    LoadChange : BOOL;
    SpeedRange : REAL;
    Integrator : INTEGRATE;
    SpeedTrigger : A_TRIG;
END_VAR

(* Calculate the integral of the current load over time *)
Integrator(IN:=CurrentLoad, DT:=T#1s, Q=>CurrentLoad);

(* Trigger an action when the load changes by a certain amount *)
SpeedTrigger(CLK:=LoadChange);

IF SpeedTrigger.Q THEN
    (* If the load exceeds the threshold, reduce the conveyor belt speed *)
    IF CurrentLoad > ThresholdLoad THEN
        DesiredSpeed := CurrentSpeed - SpeedRange;
    (* If the load is below the threshold, increase the conveyor belt speed *)
    ELSIF CurrentLoad < ThresholdLoad THEN
        DesiredSpeed := CurrentSpeed + SpeedRange;
    (* If the load is within the range, maintain the current conveyor belt speed *)
    ELSE
        DesiredSpeed := CurrentSpeed;
    END_IF;
    
    (* Ensure the conveyor belt speed does not exceed its maximum or minimum values *)
    DesiredSpeed := INC2(IN:=DesiredSpeed, MIN:=0, MAX:=100);
    
    (* Set the current conveyor belt speed to the desired speed *)
    CurrentSpeed := DesiredSpeed;
END_IF;
END_PROGRAM
```

This code assumes that the conveyor belt speed is controlled by adjusting the `CurrentSpeed` variable. The `SpeedRange` variable determines how much the speed is increased or decreased when the load changes. The `INTEGRATE` function block is used to calculate the integral of the `CurrentLoad` over time, and the `A_TRIG` function block triggers an action when the load changes. The `INC2` function is used to ensure that the `DesiredSpeed` does not exceed its maximum or minimum values.
