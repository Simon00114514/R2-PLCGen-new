Agent: Sure, here is a simple IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that should fulfill your requirements:

```plc
PROGRAM SequentialMotorControl
VAR
    Motor1, Motor2, Motor3: BOOL;
    T: TON;
    T1, T2, T3: TIME := t#10s;
END_VAR

Motor1 := TRUE;
T(IN:=Motor1, PT:=T1);
IF T.Q THEN
    Motor2 := TRUE;
    T(IN:=Motor2, PT:=T2);
END_IF
IF T.Q THEN
    Motor3 := TRUE;
    T(IN:=Motor3, PT:=T3);
END_IF
IF T.Q THEN
    Motor1 := FALSE;
    Motor2 := FALSE;
    Motor3 := FALSE;
END_IF
END_PROGRAM
```

In this program, Motor1 starts immediately when the program starts. A timer is started with Motor1, and when the timer reaches the delay time (T1), Motor2 starts. The timer is reset when Motor2 starts, and when the timer reaches the delay time (T2), Motor3 starts. The timer is reset again when Motor3 starts, and when the timer reaches the delay time (T3), all motors are stopped. This ensures that the motors start in sequence with a delay between each start, and all motors stop after 10 seconds.
