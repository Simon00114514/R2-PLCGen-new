Agent: Here is a sample 61131-3 Structured Text program that meets your requirements:

```plc
PROGRAM BottlePackaging
VAR
    ProximitySensor : BOOL; (* Input from the proximity sensor *)
    EmptyBottleSensor : BOOL; (* Input from the empty bottle sensor *)
    ConveyorBelt : BOOL; (* Output to control the conveyor belt *)
    PneumaticCylinder : BOOL; (* Output to control the pneumatic cylinder *)
END_VAR

(* Logic for the conveyor belt *)
IF ProximitySensor THEN
    ConveyorBelt := TRUE; (* Start the conveyor belt when a bottle is detected *)
ELSE
    ConveyorBelt := FALSE; (* Stop the conveyor belt when no bottle is detected *)
END_IF;

(* Logic for the pneumatic cylinder *)
IF ProximitySensor AND EmptyBottleSensor THEN
    PneumaticCylinder := TRUE; (* Activate the cylinder when an empty bottle is detected *)
ELSE
    PneumaticCylinder := FALSE; (* Deactivate the cylinder when no empty bottle is detected *)
END_IF;
END_PROGRAM
```

This program starts the conveyor belt when the proximity sensor detects a bottle and stops it when no bottle is detected. It also activates the pneumatic cylinder to remove a bottle when both the proximity sensor and the empty bottle sensor detect a bottle, and deactivates it when no empty bottle is detected.
