Agent: Here is a sample IEC 61131-3 Structured Text code that implements the water pump control system as per your requirements:

```plc
PROGRAM WaterPumpControl
VAR
    Start_PB : BOOL; (* Start button *)
    Stop_PB : BOOL; (* Stop button *)
    High_Level_Sensor : BOOL; (* High level sensor *)
    Pump : BOOL; (* Pump *)
    Drain_Valve : BOOL; (* Drain valve *)
END_VAR

(* Control logic for the pump *)
IF Start_PB AND NOT High_Level_Sensor THEN
    Pump := TRUE; (* SET the pump *)
END_IF

IF Stop_PB OR High_Level_Sensor THEN
    Pump := FALSE; (* RESET the pump *)
END_IF

(* Control logic for the drain valve *)
IF NOT Pump AND High_Level_Sensor THEN
    Drain_Valve := TRUE; (* SET the drain valve *)
END_IF

IF NOT High_Level_Sensor THEN
    Drain_Valve := FALSE; (* RESET the drain valve *)
END_IF

END_PROGRAM
```

This code first checks if the start button is pressed and the high-level sensor is not activated. If these conditions are met, it sets the pump to TRUE, which starts the pump. If the stop button is pressed or the high-level sensor is activated, it sets the pump to FALSE, which stops the pump. The drain valve is controlled similarly. If the pump is not running and the high-level sensor is activated, the drain valve is set to TRUE, which opens the drain valve. If the high-level sensor is not activated, the drain valve is set to FALSE, which closes the drain valve.
