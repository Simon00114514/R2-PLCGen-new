Agent: Here is a sample 61131-3 Structured Text program that fulfills the given requirements:

```plc
PROGRAM ConveyorBeltControl
VAR
    Sensor1, Sensor2, Sensor3, Sensor4, Sensor5: BOOL; // Input variables for the sensors
    StopButton1, StopButton2, StopButton3: BOOL; // Input variables for the stop buttons at each station
    ConveyorBeltStatus: BOOL; // Output variable for the conveyor belt status
    ConveyorBeltSpeed: REAL; // Output variable for the conveyor belt speed
END_VAR

// Implement the logic for the conveyor belt control
IF (Sensor1 OR Sensor2 OR Sensor3 OR Sensor4 OR Sensor5) AND NOT (StopButton1 OR StopButton2 OR StopButton3) THEN
    ConveyorBeltStatus := TRUE; // If any sensor detects an object and no stop button is pressed, set the conveyor belt status to on
ELSE
    ConveyorBeltStatus := FALSE; // If any stop button is pressed, set the conveyor belt status to off
END_IF

// Implement the logic for the conveyor belt speed
IF ConveyorBeltStatus THEN
    ConveyorBeltSpeed := 2.0; // If the conveyor belt status is on, set the speed to 2 meters per second
ELSE
    ConveyorBeltSpeed := 0.0; // If the conveyor belt status is off, set the speed to 0
END_IF
END_PROGRAM
```

This program will control the conveyor belt system based on the signals from the sensors and the user input from the stop buttons at each station. The speed of the conveyor belt is maintained at 2 meters per second when it is running.
