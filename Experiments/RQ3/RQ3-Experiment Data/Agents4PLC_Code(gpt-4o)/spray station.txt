Agent: Here is a sample 61131-3 Structured Text program that meets the requirements:

```plc
PROGRAM SprayStation
VAR
    ConveyorRunning : BOOL; // State of the conveyor
    SprayButton : BOOL; // State of the spray button
    CarSensor : BOOL; // State of the car sensor
    Spraying : BOOL; // State of the spray operation
    SprayTimer : TON; // Timer for the spray operation
    SprayDuration : TIME := T#3S; // Duration of the spray operation
END_VAR

// Main program
IF SprayButton AND CarSensor THEN
    ConveyorRunning := FALSE; // Stop the conveyor
    Spraying := TRUE; // Start the spray operation
    SprayTimer(IN:= TRUE, PT:= SprayDuration); // Start the timer for the spray operation
ELSE
    ConveyorRunning := TRUE; // Start the conveyor
    Spraying := FALSE; // Stop the spray operation
    SprayTimer(IN:= FALSE); // Stop the timer for the spray operation
END_IF

// Check if the spray operation is completed
IF SprayTimer.Q THEN
    SprayButton := FALSE; // Reset the spray button
    ConveyorRunning := TRUE; // Restart the conveyor
    Spraying := FALSE; // Stop the spray operation
    SprayTimer(IN:= FALSE); // Stop the timer for the spray operation
END_IF
END_PROGRAM
```

This program first checks if the spray button is pressed and the car sensor detects the car. If so, it stops the conveyor, starts the spray operation, and starts the timer for the spray operation. If not, it starts the conveyor, stops the spray operation, and stops the timer for the spray operation. 

Then, it checks if the timer for the spray operation is done. If so, it resets the spray button, restarts the conveyor, stops the spray operation, and stops the timer for the spray operation.
