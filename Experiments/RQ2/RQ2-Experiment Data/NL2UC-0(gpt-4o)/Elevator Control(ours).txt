Agent: Use case name: Elevator Control System

1. Actor:
- User (Person requesting the elevator)

2. Use case-i:
- Use Case 1: Request Elevator
- Use Case 2: Elevator Door Operation
- Use Case 3: Elevator Movement

3. System boundary:
- The system includes the elevator control software, the elevator hardware (doors, buttons, limit switches), and the timers.

4. Relationships among actors:
- Inclusion: Use Case 2 (Elevator Door Operation) is included in Use Case 1 (Request Elevator) and Use Case 3 (Elevator Movement) as the door operation is a part of both requesting the elevator and moving to different floors.
- Extension: There might be an extension for Use Case 2 in case of an emergency that requires the doors to remain open.
- Generalization: Not applicable in this context as there is only one type of actor.

For each use case, the following specification is provided:

Use Case 1: Request Elevator
- Brief Description: This use case describes the process where a user requests the elevator to arrive at their current floor.
- Event Flow:
  - Basic Flow:
    - Preconditions: User is at a floor and wishes to use the elevator.
    - Postconditions: Elevator arrives at the user's floor, doors open.
  - Alternative Flow:
    - Preconditions: Elevator is called to a floor while in transit to another floor with a higher priority request.
    - Postconditions: Elevator re-evaluates the priority and responds to the user's request after addressing the higher priority task.
- Use Case Scenario: A user presses the up or down button on their floor to call the elevator.
- Special Requirements: The system must be able to handle multiple simultaneous requests and prioritize them efficiently.
- Preconditions: The elevator is operational and not in maintenance mode.
- Postconditions: The elevator is waiting at the requested floor with doors open.

Use Case 2: Elevator Door Operation
- Brief Description: This use case manages the opening and closing of the elevator doors.
- Event Flow:
  - Basic Flow:
    - Preconditions: Elevator has arrived at the requested floor.
    - Postconditions: Doors open for 7 seconds and then close.
  - Alternative Flow:
    - Preconditions: Doors have closed, and no button has been pressed for 10 seconds.
    - Postconditions: Doors reopen.
- Use Case Scenario: Doors open when the elevator arrives at a floor and close after 7 seconds or when a button is pressed.
- Special Requirements: The door operation must be safe and comply with safety regulations.
- Preconditions: Elevator is stationary at a floor.
- Postconditions: Doors have been cycled (opened and closed) according to the timer or user interaction.

Use Case 3: Elevator Movement
- Brief Description: This use case governs the movement of the elevator between floors based on user requests and limit switches.
- Event Flow:
  - Basic Flow:
    - Preconditions: User has entered the elevator and selected a floor.
    - Postconditions: Elevator arrives at the selected floor.
  - Alternative Flow:
    - Preconditions: Elevator is in transit and a new request is made with a higher priority.
    - Postconditions: Elevator stops at the next floor according to the priority of requests.
- Use Case Scenario: The elevator moves up or down to reach the floor selected by the user inside the elevator.
- Special Requirements: The system must accurately stop at each floor using the limit switches.
- Preconditions: The elevator is correctly positioned at a floor with doors closed.
- Postconditions: The elevator has moved to the desired floor and is positioned accurately.

Priority of Use Cases:
1. Use Case 3: Elevator Movement (core functionality)
2. Use Case 2: Elevator Door Operation (safety and usability)
3. Use Case 1: Request Elevator (initial interaction)

Errors in Requirements:
- The requirement does not specify what should happen if a button is pressed while the doors are closing. This should be clarified to ensure safety and proper system response.
- The requirement does not address what happens if there is a failure in the limit switches. There should be a fail-safe mechanism in place for such scenarios.
