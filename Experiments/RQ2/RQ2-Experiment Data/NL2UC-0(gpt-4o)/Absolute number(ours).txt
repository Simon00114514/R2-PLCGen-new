Agent: Use case name: Calculate Absolute Value

1. Actor:
- User (e.g., a technician or engineer who inputs the value for which the absolute value is to be calculated)

2. Use case:
- Calculate Absolute Value

3. System boundary:
- The system boundary includes the function block within the 61131-3 environment that processes the input value and returns the absolute value.

4. Relationships among actors:
- There is no direct relationship among actors since there is only one actor, the User. However, the User interacts with the boundary object, which is the function block.

Brief Description:
This use case describes the process by which a User inputs a numerical value into the function block, and the system calculates and returns the absolute value of the input, ensuring that the result is always greater than or equal to zero.

Event Flow:
Basic Flow:
- Preconditions: The function block is loaded and operational within the 61131-3 environment.
- Postconditions: The system returns the absolute value of the input value, which is greater than or equal to zero.

Alternative Flow:
- Preconditions: The function block encounters an input value that is not a valid numerical type.
- Postconditions: The system provides an error message indicating invalid input and does not perform the absolute value calculation.

Use Case Scenario:
- A User enters a negative integer value, and the system calculates and returns the positive equivalent.
- A User enters a positive integer value, and the system returns the same positive value.
- A User enters a non-numeric value, and the system indicates an error.

Special Requirements:
- The function block must perform calculations with high reliability and accuracy.
- The system should respond within a predefined time constraint to ensure performance.
- The function block should be usable by technicians with basic training, ensuring usability.
- The system must be scalable to handle a large number of requests if necessary.

Preconditions:
- The User must have access to the 61131-3 environment and the function block.
- The function block must be correctly integrated into the user's system.

Postconditions:
- The system has returned a non-negative value as the absolute value of the input.
- If an error occurred, the system is ready to accept a new input after the User acknowledges the error message.

Priority:
- Since this use case involves a core functionality of the function block, it has high priority in the system design.

Errors and Corrections:
- If the requirement specifies that the function block should handle non-numeric inputs gracefully, the absence of error handling for such cases would be considered a requirement deficiency. The alternative flow addresses this by providing an error message for invalid inputs.

The use case design reflects the initial requirement by focusing on the calculation of the absolute value and ensuring that the result is always non-negative, as specified by the constraint.
