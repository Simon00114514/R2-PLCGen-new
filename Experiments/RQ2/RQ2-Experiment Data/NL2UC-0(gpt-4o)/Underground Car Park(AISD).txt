Based on the task description provided, here are the use cases required for the PLC program to control the entrance/exit of an underground parking garage according to the IEC 61131-3 standard:

{ 
  1: User can view the GUI.
  2: System detects when a car passes through the ground floor entrance/exit via sensor X1.
  3: System detects when a car passes through the basement entrance/exit via sensor X2.
  4: System activates motor M1 for one scan cycle when a car triggers sensor X1 from the ground floor.
  5: System activates motor M2 for one scan cycle when a car triggers sensor X1 from the basement.
  6: System activates motor M3 for one scan cycle when a car triggers sensor X2 from the basement.
  7: System activates motor M4 for one scan cycle when a car triggers sensor X2 from the ground floor.
  8: System sets intermediate variable M20 when a car enters the passage from the ground floor.
  9: System sets intermediate variable M30 when a car enters the passage from the basement.
  10: System controls the red light (Y1) at both the ground floor and basement entrance/exit.
  11: System controls the green light (Y2) at both the ground floor and basement entrance/exit.
  12: System ensures that when a car enters the passage from the ground floor, red lights on both levels are activated and green lights are turned off.
  13: System prevents any cars from entering or leaving until the car has completely passed through the passage.
  14: System reactivates green lights allowing vehicle movement once the passage is clear.
  15: System ensures that when a car enters the passage from the basement, red lights on both levels are activated.
  16: System prevents any cars from entering or leaving until the car has completely reached the ground floor from the passage.
  17: System initializes the traffic lights with green lights on and red lights off when the PLC starts running.
  18: System adheres to constraint P0: Red lights are activated on both levels when a vehicle enters the passage from the ground floor.
  19: System adheres to constraint P0: Green lights are restored on both levels after a vehicle enters the basement from the ground floor.
  20: System adheres to constraint P0: Red lights are activated on both levels when a vehicle enters the passage from the basement.
  21: System adheres to constraint P0: Green lights are restored on both levels after a vehicle leaves the parking garage.

These use cases outline the various scenarios the PLC program must handle to effectively control the traffic within the underground parking garage's entrance/exit.
