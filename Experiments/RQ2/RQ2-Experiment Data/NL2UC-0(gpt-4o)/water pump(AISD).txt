Based on the task description provided, here are the use cases required for the IEC 61131-3 structured text program to control a water pump system:

{
  1: User can press the START PB (push button) to initiate the water pump when the system is not locked.
  2: User can press the STOP PB to stop the water pump when the system is not locked.
  3: The system can automatically stop the water pump when the high water level sensor is activated (indicating the tank is full).
  4: The system can use the SET instruction to lock the motor, preventing it from being started.
  5: The system can use the RESET instruction to unlock the motor, allowing it to be started again.
  6: The system can prevent water from being pumped into the tank when the high water level is detected.
  7: User can activate the discharge valve to empty the tank when necessary.
  8: The system can provide visual feedback on the GUI indicating the current state of the water pump (running, stopped), the state of the lock (locked, unlocked), and the water level in the tank (normal, high).
  9: The system can ensure safety by not allowing the START PB to function when the system is locked or when the high water level is detected.
  10: The system can maintain the state of the water pump (running or stopped) across power cycles or program restarts, if necessary.
}

These use cases are designed to ensure that the water pump system operates safely and efficiently, adhering to the constraints specified in the task. The user interface, whether a physical control panel or a graphical user interface (GUI), should provide clear indications of the system's status and allow for easy interaction with the pump's controls.
