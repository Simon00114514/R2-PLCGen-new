Based on the task description provided, here are the use cases required for the elevator control program:

{
  1: User can press an up button on any floor to call the elevator to go up.
  2: User can press a down button on any floor to call the elevator to go down.
  3: User can press a button inside the elevator to select a floor to travel to.
  4: Elevator opens doors upon reaching a floor if the corresponding up or down button was pressed or a floor button inside the elevator was selected.
  5: Elevator keeps doors open for seven seconds to allow passengers to enter or exit.
  6: Elevator closes doors after seven seconds if no additional buttons are pressed.
  7: If no buttons are pressed within ten seconds of the doors closing, the elevator reopens the doors.
  8: Elevator stops at a floor if it is moving in the direction of a pressed up or down button on that floor.
  9: Elevator uses bottom and top limit switches on each floor to detect the position of the elevator and ensure it stops accurately at the correct location.
  10: Elevator does not open doors between floors and only opens them when a floor is reached and the elevator is properly aligned with the limit switches.
  11: Elevator responds to button presses in a way that prioritizes the current direction of travel and the requests made by the up and down buttons on each floor.
  12: Elevator logic prevents the doors from opening if the elevator has not reached a floor (i.e., neither the top nor bottom limit switch is engaged).
  13: Elevator provides a mechanism to override normal operation in case of emergency or maintenance.
  14: Elevator system includes safety checks to ensure that the doors do not open while the elevator is in motion.
  15: Elevator system includes a manual control for maintenance and emergency personnel.
}

These use cases should guide the development of the structured text program for the elevator control system, ensuring that all user interactions and constraints are considered in the design.
