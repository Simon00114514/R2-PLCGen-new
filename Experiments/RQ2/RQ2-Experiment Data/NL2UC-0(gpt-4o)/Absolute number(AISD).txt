Given the task of writing a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 to take the absolute value of the input value with the constraint that the return value is always greater than 0, the use cases required by this task can be defined as follows:

{ 
  1: User can input a numerical value into the function block.
  2: User can execute the function block to process the input value.
  3: User can receive a numerical output value from the function block.
  4: User can verify that the output value is the absolute value of the input value.
  5: User can confirm that the output value is always greater than or equal to 0.
  6: User can integrate the function block within a larger 61131-3 compliant control program.
  7: User can observe real-time processing of the input value if the function block is part of a live system.
  8: User can access documentation or help related to the use of the function block.
  9: User can modify the input value and observe corresponding changes in the output value.
 10: User can troubleshoot the function block in case of unexpected behavior or errors.
} 

Note that in the context of IEC 61131-3, "user" typically refers to a control engineer or programmer who is utilizing the function block within a programmable logic controller (PLC) program or similar industrial automation system.
