Based on the task provided, here are the use cases for the structured text program that implements feedforward control based on sensor prediction to adjust the conveyor belt speed:

{
  1: User can input the threshold value for the load.
  2: User can input the current load value from the sensor.
  3: User can specify the amount by which the conveyor belt speed should be adjusted when the load is above or below the threshold.
  4: The system can read the current load value from the sensor.
  5: The system can compare the current load value to the predefined threshold.
  6: The system can decrease the conveyor belt speed if the load exceeds the threshold.
  7: The system can increase the conveyor belt speed if the load is below the threshold.
  8: The system maintains the current conveyor belt speed if the load is within the acceptable range of the threshold.
  9: The system can provide feedback to the user about the current load and conveyor belt speed.
  10: The system can log changes in load and conveyor belt speed adjustments for monitoring and analysis.
} 

These use cases are designed to ensure that the structured text program fulfills the requirements of adjusting the conveyor belt speed based on the load, with the constraints specified in the task.
