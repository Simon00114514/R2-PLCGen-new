Agent: Use case design format:

Use case name: pH Level Control

1. Actor:
- Operator (Human user monitoring the system)
- Sensor System (pH and liquid level sensors)

2. Use case:
- Maintain pH Level
- Handle Liquid Level Alert

3. System boundary:
- IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program

4. Relationships among actors:
- Operator interacts with the Sensor System.
- Maintain pH Level includes Handle Liquid Level Alert.

For each use case, the following detailed descriptive information is provided:

Use case: Maintain pH Level

（1）Brief Description: This use case ensures that the pH level of a solution is maintained within a specified range by adjusting the rate of alkaline or acidic solution injection.

（2）Event Flow:
- Basic Flow Preconditions: System is operational, pH sensor is functional, and liquid level is below the upper limit.
- Basic Flow: The system continuously monitors the pH level. If pH < 5, the system increases the alkaline solution injection rate. If pH > 8, the system increases the acidic solution injection rate. The system maintains the pH within the range of 5 to 8.
- Basic Flow Postconditions: pH level is within the specified range.
- Alternative Flow Preconditions: pH level is within the specified range, and no liquid level alert is present.
- Alternative Flow: The system maintains the current injection rates as no adjustment is required.
- Alternative Flow Postconditions: pH level remains within the specified range.

（3）Use Case Scenario: The operator observes the system maintaining the pH level automatically, intervening only if the system alerts for high liquid level or if there is a malfunction.

（4）Special Requirements: The system must be reliable, performant, and scalable to handle different volumes of solution. It must comply with safety and environmental regulations.

（5）Preconditions: The system is initialized, and sensors are calibrated.

（6）Postconditions: The system is either in a state of adjusting the injection rates or maintaining them to keep the pH level within the specified range.

Use case: Handle Liquid Level Alert

（1）Brief Description: This use case describes the system's response when the liquid level reaches the upper limit, triggering an alert and stopping the injection of solutions.

（2）Event Flow:
- Basic Flow Preconditions: System is operational, and liquid level is below the upper limit.
- Basic Flow: The system continuously monitors the liquid level. If the upper limit is reached, an alert is triggered, and the injection of both alkaline and acidic solutions is stopped.
- Basic Flow Postconditions: Injection of solutions is stopped to prevent overflow.
- Alternative Flow Preconditions: System is operational, and liquid level is below the upper limit without triggering an alert.
- Alternative Flow: The system continues normal operation without any alerts.
- Alternative Flow Postconditions: The system continues to maintain the pH level without interruption.

（3）Use Case Scenario: The operator receives an alert for high liquid level and confirms that the system has stopped the injection of solutions.

（4）Special Requirements: The system must ensure safety by preventing overflow and must comply with environmental regulations regarding spillage.

（5）Preconditions: The system is initialized, and sensors are calibrated.

（6）Postconditions: The system has stopped the injection of solutions, and the operator is aware of the high liquid level condition.

Priority of Use Cases:
1. Maintain pH Level (High Priority): Essential for the core functionality of the system.
2. Handle Liquid Level Alert (Medium Priority): Important for safety and preventing system overflow, but secondary to maintaining the pH level.

The properties mentioned in the initial requirement, such as the pH range and the response to pH level changes, are reflected in the use case design. Any errors in the requirements, such as logical inconsistencies or missing information, would be identified and corrected during the refinement of the requirements. However, based on the information provided, the requirements appear to be logically consistent and complete.
