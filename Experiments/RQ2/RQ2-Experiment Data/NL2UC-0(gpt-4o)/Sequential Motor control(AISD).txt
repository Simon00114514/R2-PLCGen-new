Based on the task provided, here are the use cases required for the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement sequential motor control:

{
  1: User can initiate the sequence to start the motors.
  2: User can view the status of each motor (e.g., off, starting, running).
  3: User can set the time delay between the start of each motor.
  4: User can view the total elapsed time since the sequence initiation.
  5: User can receive feedback if a motor fails to start.
  6: User can stop the sequence at any time.
  7: User can reset the system to the initial state.
  8: User can view an error message if two motors attempt to start simultaneously.
  9: User can view an error message if the total start time exceeds 10 seconds.
  10: User can view a confirmation message once all motors have started successfully within the constraints.
} 

These use cases are designed to ensure that the program meets the constraints specified in the task, such as preventing simultaneous motor starts, enforcing the sequence of motor activation, and adhering to the 10-second total start time limit.
