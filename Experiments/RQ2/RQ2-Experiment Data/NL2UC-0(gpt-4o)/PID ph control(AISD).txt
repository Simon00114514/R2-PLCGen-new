Based on the task description provided, here are the use cases required for the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement PID feedback for pH control:

{
  1: User can input the desired pH setpoint within the specified range (5 to 8).
  2: User can view the current pH value of the solution.
  3: The system can automatically detect the current pH level of the solution.
  4: The system can increase the injection rate of the alkaline solution when the pH is below 5.
  5: The system can increase the injection rate of the acidic solution when the pH is above 8.
  6: The system can continuously inject both solutions until the liquid level upper limit is reached.
  7: The system can detect the liquid level using an upper limit sensor.
  8: The system can trigger an alarm when the liquid level reaches the upper limit sensor.
  9: The system can stop the injection of both solutions when the liquid level upper limit sensor alarm is activated.
  10: User can manually override the automatic pH adjustment process if necessary.
  11: User can view the status of the liquid level sensor (e.g., normal, upper limit reached).
  12: User can view the current injection rates of both the acidic and alkaline solutions.
  13: The system can log pH level adjustments and liquid level sensor alarms for future analysis.
  14: User can adjust PID control parameters to optimize the pH control process.
  15: The system can provide feedback on the effectiveness of the pH adjustment in real-time.
}

These use cases outline the interactions between the user and the system, as well as the system's automated processes for maintaining the pH level within the desired range while considering the liquid level constraints.
