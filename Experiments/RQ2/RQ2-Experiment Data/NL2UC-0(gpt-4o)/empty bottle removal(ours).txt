Agent: Use case name: Bottle Packaging Process

1. Actor:
- Packaging System Operator

2. Use case:
- UC1: Detect and Transport Bottles
- UC2: Remove Empty Bottles

3. System boundary:
- The system includes a conveyor belt, Sensor 1 (detects any bottle), Sensor 2 (detects empty bottles), and a cylinder mechanism for removing empty bottles.

4. Relationships among actors:
- UC1 <> UC2: Extension (UC2 extends UC1 when an empty bottle is detected)

For each use case, the specification is as follows:

UC1: Detect and Transport Bottles
（1）Brief Description: This use case describes the process where bottles are detected by Sensor 1 and transported to the packaging area via the conveyor belt.
（2）Event Flow:
    Basic Flow:
        Preconditions: The conveyor belt is operational.
        Postconditions: Bottles are transported to the packaging area.
    Alternative Flow:
        Preconditions: Sensor 1 is malfunctioning.
        Postconditions: Bottles are not detected or transported; an error is reported.
（3）Use Case Scenario: A bottle is placed on the conveyor belt and is detected by Sensor 1 as it moves towards the packaging area.
（4）Special Requirements: The system must handle up to 100 bottles per minute and operate with a reliability of 99.9%.
（5）Preconditions: The system is powered on and all sensors and mechanical parts are functioning correctly.
（6）Postconditions: The bottle has reached the packaging area or an error state is entered if the bottle is not detected.

UC2: Remove Empty Bottles
（1）Brief Description: This use case describes the process where empty bottles are detected by Sensor 2 and removed from the conveyor belt by the cylinder mechanism.
（2）Event Flow:
    Basic Flow:
        Preconditions: A bottle is detected by Sensor 1.
        Postconditions: Empty bottles are removed from the conveyor belt.
    Alternative Flow:
        Preconditions: Sensor 2 is malfunctioning.
        Postconditions: Empty bottles are not removed; an error is reported.
（3）Use Case Scenario: A bottle is detected by Sensor 1 and then Sensor 2 detects it as empty, triggering the cylinder to remove it from the conveyor belt.
（4）Special Requirements: The cylinder mechanism must operate within 2 seconds of an empty bottle detection to prevent delays in the packaging process.
（5）Preconditions: The system is operational and bottles are being transported on the conveyor belt.
（6）Postconditions: The conveyor belt is free of empty bottles or an error state is entered if the removal fails.

Priority of Use Cases:
- UC1: High priority as it is the primary function of the system to transport bottles to the packaging area.
- UC2: Medium priority as it is a secondary function that depends on the successful detection of bottles by UC1.

Errors in Requirements:
- The requirement "传感器同时检测到一个瓶子时将其移除" is ambiguous as it does not specify which sensor's detection should trigger the removal. It should be clarified that Sensor 2's detection of an empty bottle triggers the removal process.
