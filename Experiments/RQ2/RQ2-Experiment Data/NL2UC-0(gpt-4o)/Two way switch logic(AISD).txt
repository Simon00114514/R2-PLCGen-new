Based on the task provided, here are the use cases required for the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program to implement the two-way switch logic for controlling a light with switches on two different floors:

1. User can toggle the light on or off from the switch located on the first floor.
2. User can toggle the light on or off from the switch located on the second floor.
3. The system changes the state of the light (from on to off or off to on) when the first-floor switch is pressed.
4. The system changes the state of the light (from on to off or off to on) when the second-floor switch is pressed.
5. The system ensures that the functionality of the switch on the first floor is identical to the switch on the second floor.
6. The system maintains the last state of the light (either on or off) until a switch is pressed again.
7. The system provides feedback to the user indicating the current state of the light (optional, depending on hardware capabilities).

These use cases outline the basic interactions between the user and the system, as well as the system's internal logic required to fulfill the task.
