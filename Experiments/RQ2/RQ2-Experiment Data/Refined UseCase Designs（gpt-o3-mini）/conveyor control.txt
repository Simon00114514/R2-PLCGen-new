**Refined Requirement for Conveyor Belt Control System**

**System Overview:**
The system is an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program designed to control a conveyor belt system with three stations. It interacts with an operator and processes inputs from five sensors to manage the conveyor belt's operation.

**Actors:**
- Operator

**Use Cases:**

1. **UC1: Monitor Sensors for Object Detection**
   - **Description**: Continuously monitor five sensors for object detection.
   - **Preconditions**: Sensors are calibrated and active; system is powered on.
   - **Event Flow**: 
     - Poll sensors continuously.
     - Log detection signal if an object is detected.
     - Forward detection signal to start logic if no stop button is pressed.
   - **Postconditions**: Detection signal guides further actions.
   - **Priority**: High

2. **UC2: Process Stop Button Activation**
   - **Description**: Detect and process stop button press at any station.
   - **Preconditions**: Stop buttons are accessible and functioning.
   - **Event Flow**: 
     - Log stop command upon button press.
     - Stop command supersedes sensor detection.
     - Trigger belt stop.
   - **Postconditions**: System enters a stopped state.
   - **Priority**: High

3. **UC3: Command Conveyor Belt Start**
   - **Description**: Start the belt when a sensor detects an object and no stop button is pressed.
   - **Preconditions**: Positive sensor signal; no active stop command; belt is off.
   - **Event Flow**: 
     - Receive detection signal.
     - Check for no active stop command.
     - Send start command and trigger speed maintenance.
   - **Postconditions**: Belt moves at commanded speed.
   - **Priority**: High

4. **UC4: Command Conveyor Belt Stop**
   - **Description**: Stop the belt on stop button press or if sensor conditions are not met.
   - **Preconditions**: Stop command issued or no sensor detection.
   - **Event Flow**: 
     - Receive stop command.
     - Verify and send stop command to belt.
   - **Postconditions**: Belt stops completely.
   - **Priority**: High

5. **UC5: Maintain Conveyor Belt Speed**
   - **Description**: Ensure belt speed is maintained at 2 meters per second.
   - **Preconditions**: Belt is running.
   - **Event Flow**: 
     - Set belt motor to 2 m/s.
     - Monitor and adjust speed as needed.
   - **Postconditions**: Belt runs uniformly at 2 m/s.
   - **Priority**: Medium

**CTL Specifications:**

1. **AG((Sensors_Calibrated & System_Powered & Sensor_Detect) -> Detection_Signal);**
   - Ensures detection signal is generated when conditions are met.

2. **AG(Stop_Button_Pressed -> Stop_Command);**
   - Ensures stop command is issued upon button press.

3. **AG((Detection_Signal & !Stop_Command & !Belt_Running) -> AX((!PLC_END) | (PLC_END & Belt_Running)));**
   - Ensures belt starts running when conditions are met.

4. **AG((Stop_Command | (Belt_Running & !Sensor_Detect)) -> Belt_Stopped);**
   - Ensures belt stops under specified conditions.

5. **AG(Belt_Running -> (Belt_Speed = 2));**
   - Ensures belt speed is maintained at 2 m/s when running.

**Data Requirements:**
- Sensor Data: Real-time status from sensors.
- Button Input Data: Signals from stop buttons.
- Conveyor Belt Status Data: States and speed measurement.
- Timestamp/Data Logging: Recording times of detections and commands.

**Business Rules:**
- Belt starts only with valid sensor detection and no stop command.
- Stop command takes precedence over sensor signals.
- Belt speed must be regulated to 2 m/s once activated.
- Commands must be executed in real-time for safety and efficiency.
