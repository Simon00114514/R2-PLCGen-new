Use Case Name:
Automatic Car Wash System
Actors:
Car 
Person 
Sensor System
Alarm System 
Car Wash Control System 
Use Cases:
[UC-1]: Initiate and Execute Normal Wash Cycle – Manages the standard car wash process (start, spray, scrub, dry) from vehicle entry to exit when no safety issues are present.
[UC-2]: Monitor for Person Presence – Continuously checks for people in the wash area during active wash operations.
[UC-3]: Handle Emergency Stop (Person Detected) – Stops all wash operations and activates an alarm if a person is detected in the wash area during a cycle.
System Boundary:
Car Wash Station, specifically the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program and its interface to sensors and actuators.
Relationships Among Actors:
The Sensor System provides input (Car presence, Person presence) to the Car Wash Control System.
The Car Wash Control System executes [UC-1] based on initial sensor inputs.
The Car Wash Control System executes [UC-2] concurrently with [UC-1]'s active wash phases (spray, scrub, dry).
If [UC-2] detects a person, it triggers [UC-3].
[UC-3] commands the Car Wash Control System to stop operations and activate the Alarm System.
The Car is the subject of [UC-1]. The Person is the subject of detection for [UC-2] and [UC-3].
Detailed Descriptive Information for Each Use Case:
Use Case: [UC-1] Initiate and Execute Normal Wash Cycle
(1) Brief Description:
This use case describes the standard, uninterrupted car wash process. It starts when a car is detected and no person is present, proceeds through the wash stages (start, spray, scrub, dry), and concludes with the car leaving and the system resetting.
(2) Preconditions:
– A car is detected by the Sensor System (car_detected is true).
– No people are detected in the wash area by the Sensor System (!person_detected is true).
– The Car Wash Control System is in an idle_state.
(3) Event Flow:
Basic Flow:
1. Car Wash Control System verifies preconditions (car detected, no person, system idle).
2. Car Wash Control System initiates the "Start" operation/phase (current_stage_is_start_op). This may involve initial positioning or checks.
3. After the "Start" operation completes (e.g., start_op_complete event), system commands the "Spray" operation (current_stage_is_spray).
4. After spray duration is met (e.g., spray_time_met event), system commands the "Scrub" operation (current_stage_is_scrub).
5. After scrub duration is met (e.g., scrub_time_met event), system commands the "Dry" operation (current_stage_is_dry).
6. After dry duration is met (e.g., dry_time_met event), the dry operation completes.
7. Car Wash Control System signals car is ready to leave (car_is_ready_to_leave state/event).
8. Sensor System or Car Wash Control System detects car leaves station (car_has_left_station_event).
9. Car Wash Control System resets to an idle_state.
Alternative Flow(s):
– AF-1: Person Detected During Cycle (Handled by UC-3)
1. If [UC-2] Monitor for Person Presence signals a person detection during any active wash stage (start, spray, scrub, dry - steps 2-6):
2. This use case ([UC-1]) is immediately interrupted.
3. Control is effectively transferred to [UC-3] Handle Emergency Stop.
(4) Post Conditions:
Success:
– The car is washed according to the defined cycle (start, spray, scrub, dry).
– The car has left the station.
– The Car Wash Control System is in idle_state.
– No alarm was triggered during this use case.
Interrupted (by AF-1):
– The wash cycle is stopped prematurely.
– Further state is determined by [UC-3].
(5) Special Requirements:
– Each wash stage (start, spray, scrub, dry) must complete its defined duration/conditions unless interrupted.
– The sequence of stages must be strictly followed: Start -> Spray -> Scrub -> Dry.
Use Case: [UC-2] Monitor for Person Presence
(1) Brief Description:
This use case describes the continuous monitoring for any person within the car wash area specifically when a car wash cycle ([UC-1]) is actively performing its wash stages (start, spray, scrub, dry).
(2) Preconditions:
– [UC-1] Initiate and Execute Normal Wash Cycle is in an active wash stage (i.e., wash_cycle_active is true, meaning current stage is start, spray, scrub, or dry).
– The Sensor System (personnel detection part) is operational.
(3) Event Flow:
Basic Flow:
1. While wash_cycle_active is true:
2. The Sensor System continuously checks for the presence of a person in the wash area.
3. If no person is detected, monitoring continues.
Alternative Flow(s):
– AF-1: Person Detected
1. If the Sensor System detects a person (person_detected becomes true):
2. This use case signals the Car Wash Control System about the detection.
3. This triggers the execution of [UC-3] Handle Emergency Stop.
(4) Post Conditions:
Success (no person detected during a check cycle):
– Monitoring continues. [UC-1] proceeds.
Person Detected (AF-1):
– A person detection event is flagged.
– [UC-3] is invoked.
(5) Special Requirements:
– High-frequency and reliable person detection is critical.
Use Case: [UC-3] Handle Emergency Stop (Person Detected)
(1) Brief Description:
This use case is triggered when a person is detected in the wash area during an active car wash cycle. It ensures all operations are immediately halted and an alarm is activated.
(2) Preconditions:
– A car wash cycle is in progress (wash_cycle_active is true).
– [UC-2] Monitor for Person Presence has signaled that a person has been detected (person_detected is true).
(3) Event Flow:
Basic Flow:
1. Car Wash Control System receives person detection signal (while wash_cycle_active).
2. Car Wash Control System immediately interrupts any active stage of [UC-1].
3. Car Wash Control System commands all wash actuators (start, spray, scrub, dry mechanisms) to stop (operations_halted state).
4. Car Wash Control System activates the Alarm System (alarm_triggered state).
5. System logs the emergency event.
Alternative Flow(s): (Could include details from your first "精化后" UC3's alternative flow if desired, e.g., secondary shutdown attempt)
– AF-1: Primary Shutdown Fails
1. If the primary command to halt operations fails to achieve the operations_halted state promptly:
2. System attempts a secondary shutdown mechanism.
3. Log failure and escalation.
(4) Post Conditions:
Success:
– All car wash operations are stopped.
– The alarm is active.
– The system is in a safe, halted state (e.g., emergency_stop_state).
(5) Special Requirements:
– Stoppage of operations must be immediate.
– Alarm activation must be clear.

[D-3]: Wash Cycle Active Status (Boolean: wash_cycle_active - true if current_stage is StartOp, Spray, Scrub, or Dry)
[D-4]: Current Wash Stage (Enum: Idle, StartOp, Spray, Scrub, Dry, DryComplete_ReadyToLeave, EmergencyStop, SystemReset)
[D-5]: Operations Halted Status (Boolean: operations_halted)
[D-6]: Alarm Triggered Status (Boolean: alarm_triggered)
[D-7]: Car Has Left Station Event (Event: car_has_left_station_event)
[D-8]: Start Operation Complete Event (Event: start_op_complete)
[D-9]: Spray Time Met Event (Event: spray_time_met)
[D-10]: Scrub Time Met Event (Event: scrub_time_met)
[D-11]: Dry Time Met Event (Event: dry_time_met)

[D-13]: Primary Shutdown Failed Event (Event: primary_shutdown_failed)
[D-14]: Secondary Shutdown Attempted Event (Event: secondary_shutdown_attempted)
Business Rules:
[B-1]: The car wash cycle ([UC-1]) can only begin if a car is detected AND no person is detected AND the system is in an idle state.
[B-2]: If a person is detected (via [UC-2]) while a wash cycle ([UC-1]) is active, then [UC-3] must be invoked to immediately stop all wash operations AND trigger an alarm.
[B-3]: The normal wash cycle ([UC-1]) follows the sequence: StartOp -> Spray -> Scrub -> Dry.
[B-4]: During an active wash cycle ([UC-1]), continuous monitoring for person presence ([UC-2]) must occur.
[B-5]: Each wash stage (StartOp, Spray, Scrub, Dry) has a defined completion condition (e.g., timer elapsed or other conditions met) before transitioning to the next stage or completing the cycle.
