Based on the refined requirements and the syntax guidelines provided, I will create a Structured Text (ST) code for the Elevator Control System. The code will be structured as a `PROGRAM` since it represents a complete control task for the elevator system.

```iec
PROGRAM ElevatorControl
VAR_INPUT
    // Inputs representing call buttons on each floor for up and down directions
    UpCall: ARRAY[1..5] OF BOOL;
    DownCall: ARRAY[1..5] OF BOOL;
    // Inputs from limit switches to detect the elevator's position
    TopLimitSwitch: ARRAY[1..5] OF BOOL;
    BottomLimitSwitch: ARRAY[1..5] OF BOOL;
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    // Outputs to control the elevator motor and doors
    MotorUp: BOOL;
    MotorDown: BOOL;
    OpenDoors: BOOL;
END_VAR

VAR
    // Internal variables to manage elevator state and timers
    CurrentFloor: INT := 1;
    DesiredFloor: INT;
    DirectionUp: BOOL := TRUE; // Assume elevator starts moving up
    DoorTimer: TON;
    ReopenTimer: TON;
    DoorOpen: BOOL := FALSE;
END_VAR

(* Main control logic *)
IF DirectionUp THEN
    FOR i := CurrentFloor TO 5 DO
        IF UpCall[i] THEN
            DesiredFloor := i;
            EXIT;
        END_IF;
    END_FOR;
ELSE
    FOR i := CurrentFloor TO 1 BY -1 DO
        IF DownCall[i] THEN
            DesiredFloor := i;
            EXIT;
        END_IF;
    END_FOR;
END_IF;

// Door operation logic
IF DoorOpen THEN
    DoorTimer(IN := TRUE, PT := T#7s);
    IF DoorTimer.Q THEN
        OpenDoors := FALSE;
        DoorOpen := FALSE;
        DoorTimer(IN := FALSE, PT := T#7s); // Reset the timer
    END_IF;
ELSE
    ReopenTimer(IN := TRUE, PT := T#10s);
    IF ReopenTimer.Q THEN
        OpenDoors := TRUE;
        DoorOpen := TRUE;
        ReopenTimer(IN := FALSE, PT := T#10s); // Reset the timer
    END_IF;
END_IF;

// Elevator movement logic
IF NOT DoorOpen THEN
    IF CurrentFloor < DesiredFloor THEN
        MotorUp := TRUE;
        MotorDown := FALSE;
        DirectionUp := TRUE;
    ELSIF CurrentFloor > DesiredFloor THEN
        MotorUp := FALSE;
        MotorDown := TRUE;
        DirectionUp := FALSE;
    ELSE
        MotorUp := FALSE;
        MotorDown := FALSE;
    END_IF;
END_IF;

// Update current floor based on limit switches
IF DirectionUp AND TopLimitSwitch[CurrentFloor] THEN
    CurrentFloor := CurrentFloor + 1;
ELSIF NOT DirectionUp AND BottomLimitSwitch[CurrentFloor] THEN
    CurrentFloor := CurrentFloor - 1;
END_IF;

// Open doors when the desired floor is reached
IF CurrentFloor = DesiredFloor THEN
    OpenDoors := TRUE;
    DoorOpen := TRUE;
END_IF;

END_PROGRAM
```

This code is a simplified version and does not include all possible features and safety checks that a real-world elevator control system would require. It assumes that the elevator can only move in one direction at a time, and it does not handle simultaneous button presses or prioritize calls. Additionally, it does not include the exception handling logic for obstacles or faults, which would require additional inputs and more complex logic.
