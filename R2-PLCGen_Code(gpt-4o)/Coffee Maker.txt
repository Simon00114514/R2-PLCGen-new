Based on the refined requirements and the syntax guidelines provided, here is the Structured Text (ST) code for the coffee machine control program, adhering to the IEC 61131-3 standards and Siemens SCL syntax:

```iec
PROGRAM CoffeeMachineControl
VAR_INPUT
    emergencyStopButton : BOOL; // Input from the emergency stop button
    startButton : BOOL; // Input from the start button
    coffeeAndMilkButton : BOOL; // Input to select coffee and milk mode
    coffeeOnlyButton : BOOL; // Input to select coffee only mode
    maxLevelSensor : BOOL; // Sensor to detect if the mixer tank is at max level
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    coffeeValve : BOOL; // Controls the coffee valve
    milkValve : BOOL; // Controls the milk valve
    outputValve : BOOL; // Controls the output valve
    mixer : BOOL; // Controls the mixer
    alarm : BOOL; // Activates an alarm in case of an error
END_VAR

VAR
    mixerTimer : TON; // Timer for the mixer operation
    mixerTimerDone : BOOL; // Flag to indicate timer completion
END_VAR

(* Initialize the mixer timer *)
mixerTimer(IN := FALSE, PT := T#4s);

(* Emergency Stop logic *)
IF emergencyStopButton THEN
    coffeeValve := FALSE;
    milkValve := FALSE;
    outputValve := FALSE;
    mixer := FALSE;
    mixerTimer(IN := FALSE); // Reset the mixer timer
    RETURN; // Stop further processing
END_IF;

(* Coffee and Milk Mode logic *)
IF coffeeAndMilkButton AND NOT maxLevelSensor THEN
    coffeeValve := TRUE;
    milkValve := TRUE;
ELSIF coffeeAndMilkButton AND maxLevelSensor THEN
    coffeeValve := FALSE;
    milkValve := FALSE;
    mixer := TRUE;
    mixerTimer(IN := TRUE); // Start the mixer timer
    mixerTimerDone := mixerTimer.Q;
    IF mixerTimerDone THEN
        mixer := FALSE;
        outputValve := TRUE;
    END_IF;
ELSE
    coffeeValve := FALSE;
    milkValve := FALSE;
    mixer := FALSE;
    mixerTimer(IN := FALSE); // Reset the mixer timer
END_IF;

(* Coffee Only Mode logic *)
IF coffeeOnlyButton AND NOT maxLevelSensor THEN
    coffeeValve := TRUE;
ELSIF coffeeOnlyButton AND maxLevelSensor THEN
    coffeeValve := FALSE;
    outputValve := TRUE;
ELSE
    coffeeValve := FALSE;
END_IF;

(* Alarm logic *)
IF (coffeeAndMilkButton OR coffeeOnlyButton) AND maxLevelSensor AND (NOT coffeeValve OR NOT milkValve) THEN
    alarm := TRUE;
ELSE
    alarm := FALSE;
END_IF;

END_PROGRAM
```

Please note that this code assumes the existence of a `TON` timer function block that is compatible with the Siemens SCL environment. The `mixerTimer` is used to control the mixer's operation time.

The code is structured to handle the basic flows of the use cases provided. It includes logic for the emergency stop, coffee and milk mode, and coffee only mode. The alarm logic is also included to handle situations where the valves do not close when the maximum level is reached.

Remember to test the code in a simulation environment or with the actual hardware to ensure that it behaves as expected and complies with all safety requirements.
