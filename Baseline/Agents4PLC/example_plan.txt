Task: Design a PLC function block named `LED_Control` using structured text (ST code). The function block should contain:
    - Two Boolean input variables: `PB1` and `PB2`
    - One Boolean output variable: `LED`
    - Implement logical operation where `LED` is assigned the result of `PB1` AND (NOT `PB2`)

Retrieved Information: Boolean logic is fundamental in control systems and PLC programming. Here¡¯s a high-level overview of how to implement Boolean logic in Structured Text:
    1. **Understanding Boolean Variables**: In PLC programming, Boolean variables are used to represent two states: TRUE (1) and FALSE (0). These variables are crucial for making decisions within the control system.

Coding Plan:
    1. Define the function block `LED_Control`.
    2. Declare the input variables `PB1` and `PB2` as Boolean.
    3. Declare the output variable `LED` as Boolean.
    4. Implement the logical operation inside the function block where `LED` is assigned the result of `PB1` AND (NOT `PB2`).
    5. End the function block.
