0. DECLARE THE NEEDED STATES
   STATE 0: INITIALIZE – Prepare the function block; no computation is done yet.
   STATE 1: CHECK_INPUT – Determine whether the input value is negative or non-negative.
   STATE 2: PROCESS_NEGATIVE – If the input is negative, compute the absolute value by multiplying the input by -1.
   STATE 3: PROCESS_NON_NEGATIVE – If the input is already non-negative, pass the input as is.
   STATE 4: FINISHED – Finalize the computation and output the result.

1. LIST THE OUTPUT VALUES FOR EACH STATE
   STATE 0: No output produced.
   STATE 1: No output produced; decision branch based on input.
   STATE 2: ABS_VALUE = - (input) ; This ensures the output is positive.
   STATE 3: ABS_VALUE = input ; The output remains unchanged.
   STATE 4: The computed ABS_VALUE is available as the function block output.

2. LIST THE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN STATES
   STATE 0 -> STATE 1: On function block entry (each PLC scan cycle), move to state 1.
   STATE 1 -> STATE 2: If (input < 0) then transition to processing the negative scenario.
   STATE 1 -> STATE 3: If (input >= 0) then transition to processing the non-negative scenario.
   STATE 2 -> STATE 4: After the negative input is processed and the output computed, transition to FINISHED.
   STATE 3 -> STATE 4: After the non-negative input is processed and the output computed, transition to FINISHED.
   STATE 4 -> STATE 0: At the end of the cycle, reset to INITIALIZE for the next computation cycle.

3. DECLARE THE NEEDED VARIABLES
   state: INT;              // Variable tracking the current state of the FSM.
   inputValue: INT;         // The input value for which the absolute value is to be computed.
   absValue: INT;           // The output variable that will hold the computed absolute value.
   (Optional) prevState: INT;  // Variable to monitor state transitions if debugging/state history is needed.

NOTE: The function block will execute during each PLC scan cycle, so the computation must complete within one cycle, and then the FSM resets to state 0 ready for new input on the next scan cycle.
