Use Case Name: Underground Parking Entrance/Exit Control

1. Actor: PLC Program

2. Use case: Control of underground parking entrance/exit

3. System boundary: The system includes sensors (X1, X2), intermediate variables (M1, M2, M3, M4, M20, M30), and output devices (Y1, Y2).

4. Relationships among actors: The PLC program interacts with the sensors, intermediate variables, and output devices to control the traffic lights at the entrance/exit of the underground parking lot.

Brief Description: The PLC program controls the traffic lights at the entrance/exit of the underground parking lot according to the IEC 61131-3 standard. The program responds to the sensors and changes the state of the traffic lights accordingly.

Event Flow:
Basic Flow:
- Preconditions: The traffic lights are initially set to green.
- The car enters the entrance from the ground floor, triggering sensor X1.
- The PLC program responds by turning on the red lights (Y1) at both the ground floor and basement entrances/exits, and turning off the green lights (Y2).
- The car leaves the entrance and enters the basement, triggering sensor X2.
- The PLC program responds by turning off the red lights and turning on the green lights.
- Postconditions: The traffic lights return to their initial state (green).

Alternative Flow:
- Preconditions: The traffic lights are initially set to green.
- The car leaves the basement and enters the exit, triggering sensor X2.
- The PLC program responds by turning on the red lights at both the ground floor and basement entrances/exits, and turning off the green lights.
- The car leaves the exit and reaches the ground floor, triggering sensor X1.
- The PLC program responds by turning off the red lights and turning on the green lights.
- Postconditions: The traffic lights return to their initial state (green).

Special Requirements: The PLC program must comply with the IEC 61131-3 standard.

Priority: High (Critical for the operation of the underground parking lot)

Please note that this is a simplified version of the use case based on the provided information. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider more details and possible exceptions.
