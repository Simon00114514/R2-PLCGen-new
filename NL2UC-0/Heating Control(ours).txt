Agent: To begin with, let's define the initial requirement: 

The requirement is to develop an independent 61131-3 structured text program, not a function block, to control the temperature of a heating system. The system should automatically turn on and off based on three temperature sensors and maintain a constant temperature range of 20 to 25 degrees Celsius. The temperature is represented in integer form.

Now, let's refine the requirements and design the use cases:

Use Case 1: Monitor Temperature
Event Flow:
1. The system reads the temperature from the three sensors.
2. The system calculates the average temperature.
3. The system compares the average temperature with the desired range (20-25 degrees Celsius).

Alternative Flow:
If any sensor fails to provide a reading, the system will calculate the average temperature based on the readings from the other sensors.

Use Case 2: Control Heating System
Event Flow:
1. If the average temperature is below 20 degrees Celsius, the system turns on the heating system.
2. If the average temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius, the system turns off the heating system.

Alternative Flow:
If the heating system fails to respond to the system's command, an error message is generated.

Priority: Use Case 1 is the highest priority as it provides the necessary data for Use Case 2. Use Case 2 is the second priority as it directly controls the heating system based on the data from Use Case 1.

Errors: There could be errors in sensor readings or in the heating system's response to commands. These are addressed in the alternative flows.

The properties mentioned in the initial requirement (three temperature sensors, temperature range of 20-25 degrees Celsius, and temperature represented in integer form) are reflected in the use cases.

The use case design is in the requested format.
