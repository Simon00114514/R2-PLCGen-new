Based on the task provided, here are the use cases for the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for PID feedback control of a distillation tower liquid level:

{
  1: "User can input the desired threshold liquid level for the distillation tower.",
  2: "User can input PID control parameters (Proportional, Integral, Derivative gains).",
  3: "System reads the current liquid level from the appropriate sensor.",
  4: "System calculates the PID control value based on the difference between the current liquid level and the threshold.",
  5: "System opens the inlet valve if the liquid level is below the threshold.",
  6: "System closes the inlet valve if the liquid level is at the threshold.",
  7: "System adjusts the inlet valve opening proportionally based on the PID control value to maintain the liquid level at the threshold.",
  8: "User can manually override the PID control to open or close the inlet valve.",
  9: "System provides real-time feedback on the current liquid level and valve status to the user.",
 10: "System logs all control actions and liquid level changes for future analysis and troubleshooting."
}

These use cases outline the basic functionality required for the PID feedback control system as per the constraints provided. They ensure that the user has control over the initial settings and can monitor and adjust the system as needed. The system is designed to maintain the liquid level at a specified threshold by manipulating the inlet valve based on PID calculations.
