Given the task to create a structured text program compliant with IEC 61131-3 for controlling the mix of two reactants at a ratio of 100:1, the following use cases can be derived:

{
  1: "User can input the desired mixture ratio (default set to 100 parts of Reactant A to 1 part of Reactant B).",
  2: "User can start the mixing process through the GUI.",
  3: "User can monitor the current mixing ratio in real-time.",
  4: "System automatically adjusts the input rate of Reactant B based on the current mixing ratio.",
  5: "System decreases the input rate of Reactant B when the ratio exceeds 102:1 (within a margin of 2).",
  6: "System increases the input rate of Reactant B when the ratio falls below 98:1 (within a margin of 2).",
  7: "System maintains the current input rate of Reactant B when the ratio is approximately 100:1 (within a margin of 2).",
  8: "User can manually override the input rate adjustment if needed.",
  9: "User can stop the mixing process through the GUI.",
 10: "System provides alerts or warnings if the mixture ratio falls outside the acceptable range (beyond the margin of 2).",
 11: "User can access historical data on the mixture ratios and input rate adjustments for review and analysis."
}

These use cases are designed to ensure that the user has full control over the mixing process while the system automates the maintenance of the desired ratio within the specified constraints.
