6. Detailed Descriptive Information for Each Use Case:

Use Case: Start Water Pump
(1) Brief Description:
The user starts the water pump by pressing the start push button (PB).
(2) Preconditions:
The water pump is not latched.
(3) Event Flow:
Basic Flow:
User presses the start PB.
Water pump starts.
Alternative Flow:
None.
(4) Postconditions:
The water pump is latched (SET).
(5) Use Case Scenario:
The water tank is empty and needs to be filled. The user presses the start PB to start the water pump.
(6) Special Requirements:
The water pump must not be latched before the start PB is pressed.

Use Case: Stop Water Pump
(1) Brief Description:
The user stops the water pump by pressing the stop push button (PB).
(2) Preconditions:
The water pump is latched (SET).
(3) Event Flow:
Basic Flow:
User presses the stop PB.
Water pump stops.
Alternative Flow:
None.
(4) Postconditions:
The water pump is unlatched (RESET).
(5) Use Case Scenario:
The water tank is full and the water pump needs to be stopped. The user presses the stop PB to stop the water pump.
(6) Special Requirements:
The water pump must be latched (SET) before the stop PB is pressed.

Use Case: Fill Water Tank
(1) Brief Description:
The water pump fills the water tank until the high water level is reached.
(2) Preconditions:
The water pump is latched (SET).
(3) Event Flow:
Basic Flow:
Water pump starts.
Water fills the tank until the high water level is reached.
High-level sensor is activated.
Water pump stops.
Alternative Flow:
None.
(4) Postconditions:
The water tank is full.
The water pump is unlatched (RESET).
(5) Use Case Scenario:
The water tank is empty and needs to be filled. The water pump is started and fills the tank until the high water level is reached. The high-level sensor is activated and the water pump stops.
(6) Special Requirements:
The high-level sensor must be functional and correctly calibrated.

Use Case: Empty Water Tank
(1) Brief Description:
The discharge valve is used to empty the water tank.
(2) Preconditions:
The water tank is full.
(3) Event Flow:
Basic Flow:
Discharge valve is opened.
Water drains from the tank.
Discharge valve is closed.
Alternative Flow:
None.
(4) Postconditions:
The water tank is empty.
(5) Use Case Scenario:
The water tank is full and needs to be emptied. The discharge valve is opened and the water drains from the tank. The discharge valve is then closed.
(6) Special Requirements:
The discharge valve must be functional and correctly operated.

7. Priority of Use Cases:
Start Water Pump: High
Stop Water Pump: High
Fill Water Tank: Medium
Empty Water Tank: Low

8. Data Requirements:
D-1: Status of water pump (latched/unlatched)
D-2: Water level in the tank (high/low)
D-3: Status of discharge valve (open/closed)

9. Business Rules (Optional):
