Agent: Use case name: Liquid Mixing Application

1. Actor:
- Operator

2. Use case:
- Fill Tank with Liquid 1
- Fill Tank with Liquid 2
- Mix Liquids and Stir
- Prepare Mixed Solution and Drain Tank

3. System boundary:
- IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program

4. Relationships among actors:
- Inclusion: "Mix Liquids and Stir" is included in both "Fill Tank with Liquid 1" and "Fill Tank with Liquid 2".
- Extension: "Prepare Mixed Solution and Drain Tank" extends "Mix Liquids and Stir" with additional steps.
- Generalization: Not applicable in this context.

Use case specification for "Fill Tank with Liquid 1":

（1）Brief Description: This use case allows the operator to fill the tank with Liquid 1 by pressing button S1.

（2）Event Flow:
- Basic Flow:
  - Preconditions: The tank is not full.
  - Postconditions: Liquid 1 is in the tank, and if the tank is full, the motor M starts stirring.
- Alternative Flow:
  - Preconditions: The tank is full.
  - Postconditions: Button S1 is disabled, and motor M is running to stir the mixture.

（3）Use Case Scenario: The operator presses button S1, and the system pours Liquid 1 into the tank until the high liquid level is reached or the operator stops the process.

（4）Special Requirements: The system must ensure accurate control of the liquid level and provide feedback to the operator.

（5）Preconditions: The tank must not be full, and button S1 must be operational.

（6）Postconditions: Liquid 1 is added to the tank, and if the tank reaches full capacity, the stirring process is initiated.

Use case specification for "Prepare Mixed Solution and Drain Tank":

（1）Brief Description: This use case describes the process where the operator prepares the mixed solution by pressing button S3, which stops the filling process, starts the motor M for stirring, and then opens valve V1 to drain the tank.

（2）Event Flow:
- Basic Flow:
  - Preconditions: The tank contains Liquid 1 and/or Liquid 2, and the motor M is not running.
  - Postconditions: The tank is drained, and the mixed solution is prepared.
- Alternative Flow:
  - Preconditions: The motor M is already running or the tank is empty.
  - Postconditions: The system does not allow draining if the tank is empty or the motor does not start if it is already running.

（3）Use Case Scenario: The operator presses button S3, which triggers the system to stop filling, start the motor M if not already running, and open valve V1 to drain the mixed solution.

（4）Special Requirements: The system must ensure that the motor M and valve V1 operate correctly and safely.

（5）Preconditions: The tank contains liquids that need to be mixed, and valve V1 is closed.

（6）Postconditions: The mixed solution is prepared, and the tank is drained.

Priority of use cases:
1. Fill Tank with Liquid 1
2. Fill Tank with Liquid 2
3. Mix Liquids and Stir
4. Prepare Mixed Solution and Drain Tank

The priority is determined based on the sequence of operations required to achieve the final objective of preparing a mixed solution. Each use case must be completed successfully before the next can be initiated. The properties from the initial requirement, such as the buttons S1, S2, S3, and valve V1, are reflected in the use case design. Potential errors in the requirements have been addressed by specifying preconditions and postconditions for each event flow to ensure logical consistency and system integrity.
