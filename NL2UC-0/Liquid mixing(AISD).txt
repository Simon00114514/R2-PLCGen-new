Based on the task provided, here are the use cases for the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for a liquid mixing application:

{
  1: "User can initiate pouring of Liquid 1 by pressing Button S1.",
  2: "User can initiate pouring of Liquid 2 by pressing Button S2.",
  3: "System automatically stops pouring Liquid 1 and Liquid 2 when the maximum liquid level is reached and starts Motor M for stirring.",
  4: "User can initiate the preparation of the mixed solution by pressing Button S3, which stops pouring Liquid 1 and Liquid 2, starts Motor M for stirring, and then opens Valve V1 to discharge the liquid from the tank.",
  5: "User can observe the liquid level in the tank to monitor the mixing process.",
  6: "User can manually operate Valve V1 to discharge the liquid from the tank as needed, separate from the automated process triggered by Button S3."
}

These use cases translate the task's requirements into specific actions that the user can perform and the system's automated responses. The program logic will need to account for these scenarios to ensure proper operation of the liquid mixing application.
