Agent: Use case design format:

Use case name: Conveyor Speed Adjustment Based on Load Prediction

1. Actor:
- Sensor System (detects load)
- Conveyor Control System (adjusts conveyor speed)

2. Use case:
- Adjust Conveyor Speed

3. System boundary:
- The system includes the Sensor System and the Conveyor Control System.

4. Relationships among actors:
- The Sensor System includes the use case.
- The Conveyor Control System extends the use case when adjustments are needed.

Brief Description:
This use case describes the process by which the Conveyor Control System adjusts the conveyor belt's speed in response to the load predicted by the Sensor System. The goal is to maintain optimal conveyor performance and prevent overloading or underutilization.

Event Flow:
Basic Flow:
- Preconditions: The Sensor System is operational and the Conveyor Control System is in standby mode, ready to receive input.
- Postconditions: The conveyor speed is adjusted to the optimal level based on the current load, maintaining system efficiency.

Alternative Flow:
- Preconditions: The Sensor System detects a load that is outside the predefined threshold range.
- Postconditions: The Conveyor Control System adjusts the conveyor speed to bring the load within the acceptable range.

Use Case Scenario:
- A typical scenario involves the Sensor System detecting the load on the conveyor and predicting whether it will exceed the threshold. If a prediction is made that the load will exceed the threshold, the Conveyor Control System responds by adjusting the speed accordingly.

Special Requirements:
- The system must be reliable and perform adjustments in real-time to prevent delays.
- The system must be scalable to accommodate different conveyor sizes and loads.
- The system must comply with safety regulations for conveyor operations.

Preconditions:
- The Sensor System must be calibrated and functioning correctly.
- The Conveyor Control System must be connected to the Sensor System and able to receive data.

Postconditions:
- The conveyor speed is adjusted, ensuring the load remains within the specified threshold.
- The system returns to a monitoring state, ready to respond to further changes in load.

Priority:
- The primary use case is the adjustment of the conveyor speed, which is critical for maintaining operational efficiency and preventing damage to the conveyor or the product being transported.

Errors and Corrections:
- If the Sensor System provides inaccurate data, the Conveyor Control System might make incorrect adjustments. This error can be mitigated by implementing a calibration and validation process for the sensors.
- If the Conveyor Control System fails to adjust the speed when required, it could lead to system inefficiency or damage. This can be addressed by incorporating redundancy and a fail-safe mechanism.
