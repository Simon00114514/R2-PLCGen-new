Given the task of creating a structured text program based on the IEC 61131-3 standard for a bottle packaging system, the use cases would focus on the interactions between the system and the sensors, as well as the actions taken by the system in response to sensor inputs. Here are the use cases derived from the task:

{
  1: User can start and stop the conveyor belt system.
  2: User can monitor the status of Sensor 1 which detects the presence of any bottle.
  3: User can monitor the status of Sensor 2 which detects the presence of empty bottles.
  4: The system can differentiate between a bottle detected by Sensor 1 and an empty bottle detected by both Sensor 1 and Sensor 2.
  5: The system can activate a cylinder to remove a bottle when both sensors detect a bottle simultaneously (indicating it is an empty bottle).
  6: User can view the count of removed empty bottles.
  7: User can view system alerts or errors (e.g., sensor malfunction, cylinder failure).
  8: User can reset the count of removed bottles.
  9: User can manually override the system to remove a bottle.
  10: User can access historical data of the system's operation (e.g., number of bottles processed, number of empty bottles removed).
}

These use cases would guide the development of the structured text program, ensuring that all necessary functions are included and that the system behaves as expected in response to the sensors' inputs.
