PROGRAM ConveyorBeltControl
// This standalone IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program controls a conveyor belt system.
// The system consists of three user stations and five sensors. 
// The start command, stop command, and sensor inputs are represented as INT values (1 = true, 0 = false).
// When the start command is issued and at least one sensor detects an object (value 1) while no stop command is active,
// the conveyor belt runs with a constant speed of 2 m/s. Otherwise, the belt remains stopped.
