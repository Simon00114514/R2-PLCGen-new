Agent: Here is a basic PLC program in Structured Text (ST) language that meets the requirements:

```plc
PROGRAM CarWash
VAR
    VehicleSensor : BOOL; // Input from vehicle sensor
    PersonnelSensor : BOOL; // Input from personnel sensor
    StartWash : BOOL; // Output to start the car wash process
    Spray : BOOL; // Output for spray stage
    Scrub : BOOL; // Output for scrub stage
    Dry : BOOL; // Output for dry stage
    Alarm : BOOL; // Output for alarm
END_VAR

IF VehicleSensor AND NOT PersonnelSensor THEN
    StartWash := TRUE;
    Spray := TRUE;
    Scrub := TRUE;
    Dry := TRUE;
ELSE
    StartWash := FALSE;
    Spray := FALSE;
    Scrub := FALSE;
    Dry := FALSE;
END_IF;

IF PersonnelSensor THEN
    Alarm := TRUE;
    StartWash := FALSE;
    Spray := FALSE;
    Scrub := FALSE;
    Dry := FALSE;
ELSE
    Alarm := FALSE;
END_IF;
END_PROGRAM
```

This program starts the car wash process when a vehicle is detected and no person is detected in the car wash area. If a person is detected at any point, the car wash process stops and an alarm is triggered. The car wash process is divided into distinct stages (start, spray, scrub, dry) for clarity and control.
