Agent: Sure, here is a complete standalone program implementing the two-way switch logic:

```iecst
PROGRAM TwoWaySwitch
VAR
	PB1 : BOOL; // Input from switch 1
	PB2 : BOOL; // Input from switch 2
	LED : BOOL; // Output to the LED light
END_VAR

BEGIN
	LED := PB1 XOR PB2; // LED control logic
END_PROGRAM
```

In this program, `PB1` and `PB2` represent the state of the two switches. The `LED` variable represents the state of the LED light. The logic is implemented such that the LED light is toggled whenever either switch is toggled. This is achieved using the XOR (exclusive OR) operation.
