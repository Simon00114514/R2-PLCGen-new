Agent: Here is a sample Structured Text program that fulfills the requirements:

```iecst
PROGRAM TemperatureControl
VAR
    Temp1 : INT;
    Temp2 : INT;
    Temp3 : INT;
    HeatingDevice : BOOL;
    AverageTemp : INT;
END_VAR

AverageTemp := (Temp1 + Temp2 + Temp3) / 3;

IF AverageTemp < 20 THEN
    HeatingDevice := TRUE;
ELSIF AverageTemp > 25 THEN
    HeatingDevice := FALSE;
ELSE
    // Maintain the current state of the heating device
END_IF;

END_PROGRAM
```

In this program, the `AverageTemp` variable calculates the average temperature from the three sensors. If the average temperature is below 20 degrees Celsius, the heating device is turned on. If the average temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius, the heating device is turned off. If the average temperature is between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius, the current state of the heating device is maintained.
