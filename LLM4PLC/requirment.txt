Write a standalone 61131-3 Structured Text program, not a function block, to control a traffic light system. The system should respond to pedestrian button presses and the presence of emergency vehicles, granting them priority.
Constraints:
1.When the pedestrian button is pressed, if there are no approaching vehicles and the current light is red, switch to green.
2.When an approaching vehicle is detected, immediately switch to yellow, then to red.
3.The traffic lights should cycle normally (green -> yellow -> red).
4.Only one light should be on at any given time.
5.Emergency vehicles have higher priority than pedestrian button presses.
