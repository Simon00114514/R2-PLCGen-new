Agent: To translate the patterns design into CTL or LTL logic specifications for the Sequential Motor Control System, follow these steps:

1. **Variable Design:**
   - Define separate variables for each motor's start and stop states to ensure mutual exclusivity.
   - Example variables: `Motor1_Start`, `Motor1_Stop`, `Motor2_Start`, `Motor2_Stop`, `Motor3_Start`, `Motor3_Stop`.

2. **Property Specifications:**
   - **Sequential Start:** Ensure motors start in sequence with delays.
     - CTL: `AG(Motor1_Stop -> AX(Motor2_Start))`
     - CTL: `AG(Motor2_Stop -> AX(Motor3_Start))`
   - **Mutual Exclusivity:** No two motors should start simultaneously.
     - CTL: `AG(!(Motor1_Start & Motor2_Start))`
     - CTL: `AG(!(Motor2_Start & Motor3_Start))`
     - CTL: `AG(!(Motor1_Start & Motor3_Start))`
   - **Completion within Time Constraint:** Ensure the sequence completes within 10 seconds.
     - CTL: AG(timer = 10)
   - **Error Handling:** If a motor fails to start, halt operation.
     - CTL: `AG((Motor1_Error | Motor2_Error | Motor3_Error) -> AX(Operation_Halt))`

3. **Syntax Rules:**
   - Use CTL for branching-time properties and LTL for linear-time constraints.
   - Ensure no mixing of CTL and LTL in a single specification.

4. **Output Format:**
   - Each pattern corresponds to one CTL or LTL specification.
   - Separate specifications with semicolons.
   - Example:
     - `{1}: AG(Motor1_Stop -> AX(Motor2_Start));`
     - `{2}: AG(!(Motor1_Start & Motor2_Start));`
     - `{3}: G((Motor1_Start & X(Motor3_Stop)) -> F(timer <= 10));`

By following these guidelines, the Sequential Motor Control System's operation can be accurately modeled and verified using CTL and LTL logic specifications.
