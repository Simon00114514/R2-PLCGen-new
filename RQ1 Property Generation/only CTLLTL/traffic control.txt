Agent: Here is a comprehensive set of CTL specifications for the Traffic Light Control System, formatted for nuXmv:

1. **Normal Traffic Light Cycle:**
   - **Basic Flow:**
     ```
     SPEC AG(system_active & !pedestrian_request & !vehicle_detected & !emergency_detected -> AF(light_green & AX(light_yellow & AX(light_red)));
     ```

2. **Process Pedestrian Request:**
   - **Basic Flow:**
     ```
     SPEC AG(pedestrian_button_pressed & light_red & !vehicle_detected & !emergency_detected -> (light_green));
     ```

   - **Alternative Flow:**
     ```
     SPEC AG(pedestrian_button_pressed & (vehicle_detected | emergency_detected) -> AX(!light_green));
     ```

3. **Process Approaching Vehicle:**
   - **Basic Flow:**
     ```
     SPEC AG(vehicle_detected & !emergency_detected -> AF(light_yellow & AX(light_red)));
     ```

   - **Alternative Flow:**
     ```
     SPEC AG(vehicle_detected & AX(vehicle_detected) -> AF(light_red));
     ```

4. **Process Emergency Vehicle Request:**
   - **Basic Flow:**
     ```
     SPEC AG(emergency_detected -> AF(light_red));
     ```

   - **Alternative Flow:**
     ```
     SPEC AG(emergency_detected & pedestrian_request -> (light_red));
     ```

5. **Handle System/Sensor Failure:**
   - **Basic Flow:**
     ```
     SPEC AG(sensor_error | system_error -> AF(safe_state));
     ```

   - **Post Conditions:**
     ```
     SPEC AG(sensor_error | system_error -> AX(maintenance_alerted));
     ```

These CTL expressions are designed to ensure that the system adheres to the specified requirements and handles various scenarios appropriately, using the correct syntax for nuXmv.
