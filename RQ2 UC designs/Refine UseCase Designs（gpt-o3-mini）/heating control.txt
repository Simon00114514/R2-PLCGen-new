**Refined Requirement: Heating System Temperature Control**

**1. Use Case Name: Maintain Temperature**

**Actors:**
- Temperature Sensor (three independent sensor inputs)
- Heating Device (controlled device)
- Maintenance Engineer (for system oversight, configuration, or troubleshooting)

**Use Cases:**
- **Monitor Sensor Data:** Acquire temperature readings from three sensors.
- **Evaluate Temperature:** Determine system actions based on sensor values.
- **Control Heating Device:** Switch the heating device on or off as required.
- **Handle Sensor Anomalies:** Manage conflicting, missing, or erroneous sensor data.

**System Boundary:**
IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program for Heating System Temperature Control

**Relationships Among Actors:**
- Temperature Sensors continuously provide temperature data.
- The system sends control commands to the Heating Device.
- The Maintenance Engineer receives alerts and may interact with the system for configuration, troubleshooting, or override operations.
- “Monitor Sensor Data” and “Evaluate Temperature” are core functions used by “Maintain Temperature.”
- “Handle Sensor Anomalies” is triggered as an extension when sensor data issues occur.

**Detailed Descriptive Information for Each Use Case:**

**Use Case: Maintain Temperature**
- **Brief Description:** Continuously regulate the ambient temperature between 20°C and 25°C by gathering sensor data and controlling the heating device accordingly.
- **Preconditions:** The program is active, sensors are functioning, and the heating device is ready.
- **Event Flow:** 
  - Sensors read temperatures.
  - Data is collected and evaluated.
  - Commands are issued to control the heating device.
  - Anomalies are handled as needed.
- **Postconditions:** The heating device reflects the updated state, and logs are maintained.
- **Priority:** High

**Use Case: Monitor Sensor Data**
- **Brief Description:** Collect temperature readings from each sensor.
- **Preconditions:** Sensors are installed and calibrated.
- **Event Flow:** 
  - Sensors send readings.
  - Data is organized for processing.
- **Postconditions:** Data is captured and logged.
- **Priority:** High

**Use Case: Evaluate Temperature**
- **Brief Description:** Analyze sensor data to decide on actions.
- **Preconditions:** Valid data from at least two sensors.
- **Event Flow:** 
  - Aggregate readings.
  - Compare against thresholds.
- **Postconditions:** A command decision is produced.
- **Priority:** High

**Use Case: Control Heating Device**
- **Brief Description:** Execute commands to adjust the heating device.
- **Preconditions:** A clear control decision exists.
- **Event Flow:** 
  - Commands are sent based on temperature.
- **Postconditions:** The device is set to the desired state.
- **Priority:** High

**Use Case: Handle Sensor Anomalies**
- **Brief Description:** Manage conditions when sensors provide conflicting data.
- **Preconditions:** At least one sensor reading is flagged.
- **Event Flow:** 
  - Detect anomalies.
  - Apply fallback logic.
- **Postconditions:** Anomalies are documented and managed.
- **Priority:** Medium

**CTL Specifications:**

1. **Invariant Pattern:**
   - **Description:** Ensure the average temperature remains between 20°C and 25°C at the end of each PLC cycle.
   - **CTL Specification:** `AG(20 <= Avg_Temp & Avg_Temp <= 25);`

2. **Implication Pattern:**
   - **Description:** If the average temperature is below 20°C, turn the heating device on.
   - **CTL Specification:** `AG(Avg_Temp < 20 -> Heating_On);`

3. **Implication Pattern:**
   - **Description:** If the average temperature exceeds 25°C, turn the heating device off.
   - **CTL Specification:** `AG(Avg_Temp > 25 -> Heating_Off);`

4. **Implication Pattern:**
   - **Description:** Maintain the previous state if a sensor anomaly is detected.
   - **CTL Specification:** `AG(Sensor_Anomaly -> Maintain_PreviousState);`
