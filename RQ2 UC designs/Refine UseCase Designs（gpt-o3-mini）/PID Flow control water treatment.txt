### Revised Use Case Design

1. **Use Case Name**: PID Feedback Flow Control for Chlorine Dosing in Water Treatment

2. **Actors**:
   - **Actor 1**: IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program (System)
   - **Actor 2**: Chlorine Dosing Mechanism (External system)

3. **Use Case**: Control the flow rate of chlorine dosing in water treatment based on PID feedback.

4. **System Boundary**:
   - **Internal**: IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program
   - **External**: Chlorine Dosing Mechanism, Water Treatment Environment

5. **Relationships Among Actors**: The IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program interacts with the Chlorine Dosing Mechanism to control the flow rate.

6. **Detailed Descriptive Information for Each Use Case**:

   **Use Case**: PID Feedback Flow Control for Chlorine Dosing in Water Treatment

   (1) **Brief Description**: The use case involves the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program controlling the flow rate of chlorine dosing in a water treatment process based on PID feedback. The dosing rate is 3 ppm, and the sampling rate is 100 milliseconds.

   (2) **Preconditions**: The system is operational, and all devices are in a normal working state.

   (3) **Event Flow**:

   - **Basic Flow**:
     - The system samples the chlorine concentration every 100 milliseconds.
     - If the concentration is below the threshold, the system increases the flow rate.
     - If the concentration is above the threshold, the system reduces the flow rate.
     - If the concentration is within the acceptable range, the flow rate remains unchanged.

   - **Alternative Flow**:
     - If the system detects an error or malfunction in the chlorine dosing mechanism, it triggers an alarm, stops the dosing process, and logs the error for further analysis.

   (4) **Postconditions**: The chlorine concentration in the water is maintained within the acceptable range.

   (5) **Use Case Scenario**: In a water treatment process, the system continuously monitors the chlorine concentration. If the concentration deviates from the acceptable range, the system adjusts the flow rate of the chlorine dosing mechanism accordingly.

   (6) **Special Requirements**: The system must comply with the IEC 61131-3 standard for structured text programming. It must also ensure the safety and reliability of the water treatment process.

7. **Priority of Use Cases**: High (as it's critical for the water treatment process)
