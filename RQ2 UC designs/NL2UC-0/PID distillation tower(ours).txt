Agent: Use case name: Distillation Tower Level PID Control

1. Actor:
- Control Engineer (primary)
- Distillation Tower System (secondary)

2. Use case:
- ManageDistillationTowerLevel

3. System boundary:
- Distillation Tower Level Control System

4. Relationships among actors:
- The Control Engineer (primary actor) interacts with the Distillation Tower Level Control System (secondary actor) to maintain the liquid level within the desired threshold.

Brief Description:
This use case describes the process by which the Control Engineer manages the liquid level in a distillation tower using a PID feedback control mechanism. The system monitors the liquid level and adjusts the inlet valve accordingly to maintain the level within a specified threshold.

Event Flow:
Basic Flow:
Preconditions: The system is powered on, and all sensors and actuators are operational.
1. The system reads the current liquid level from the sensor.
2. The system calculates the PID control values based on the current liquid level.
3. If the liquid level is below the threshold, the system opens the inlet valve.
4. If the liquid level is at the threshold, the system closes the inlet valve.
5. The system sends the output signal to the inlet valve to adjust the liquid level.
Postconditions: The liquid level is maintained within the threshold limits.

Alternative Flow:
Preconditions: The system is powered on, but a sensor or actuator is not operational.
1. The system detects a fault in the sensor or actuator.
2. The system enters a safe mode to prevent overflow or dry running of the distillation tower.
3. The Control Engineer is alerted to the fault.
4. The Control Engineer performs necessary maintenance.
5. The system resumes normal operation after maintenance is complete.
Postconditions: The system is fully operational, and the liquid level is maintained within the threshold limits.

Use Case Scenario:
- A scenario where the liquid level drops rapidly due to an increase in distillation rate and the system must adjust the inlet valve more frequently to maintain the level.
- A scenario where the sensor fails and the system must rely on a backup sensor or manual readings until the primary sensor is repaired.

Special Requirements:
- The system must perform reliably under continuous operation.
- The PID control algorithm must be tuned to respond accurately to changes in the liquid level.
- The system must comply with IEC 61131-3 standards for structured text programming.

Preconditions:
- The system has been correctly configured and calibrated.
- The sensors and actuators are connected and functioning.

Postconditions:
- The distillation tower liquid level is maintained within the specified threshold.
- Any faults have been logged and addressed by the Control Engineer.

Priority:
- The primary use case is the management of the distillation tower liquid level, which is of the highest priority as it directly impacts the safety and efficiency of the distillation process.

Errors:
- If the requirements do not specify the behavior of the system in case of sensor failure, this is a deficiency that needs to be addressed by adding an alternative flow for fault detection and handling.
- If the requirements do not include details on how the PID control values are calculated or how the system should respond to rapid changes in liquid level, these should be clarified to ensure the system behaves as expected under all conditions.
