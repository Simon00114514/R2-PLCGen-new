Based on the task provided, here are the use cases that need to be developed for the traffic light control system:

1. User can initiate the traffic light control program.
2. User can press a button to signal a pedestrian request to cross the street.
3. User can press an emergency button to signal the presence of an emergency vehicle.
4. System can detect a pedestrian button press and queue a pedestrian crossing request.
5. System can detect an emergency button press and prioritize the emergency vehicle crossing.
6. System can change the traffic light to red in all directions when the emergency button is pressed.
7. System can manage traffic light states to ensure only one light is green at any given time.
8. System can transition the traffic lights through the standard green-yellow-red cycle under normal operation.
9. System can override the normal operation and provide a green light for the direction of the emergency vehicle.
10. System can resume normal traffic light operation after an emergency vehicle has passed.
11. System can provide visual or auditory feedback when a pedestrian or emergency button is pressed.
12. System can maintain a safe interval between changing lights from green to red to prevent accidents.
13. System can log all button presses and traffic light state changes for maintenance and analysis purposes.

These use cases aim to ensure that the traffic light control system operates efficiently, prioritizing safety and responsiveness to both pedestrian and emergency vehicle requests.
