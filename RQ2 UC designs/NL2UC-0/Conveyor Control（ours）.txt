Agent: Use case design:

Use case name: Conveyor Belt Control

1. Actor:
   - User
   - Conveyor Belt System
   - Sensors

2. Use case:
   - Start Conveyor Belt
   - Stop Conveyor Belt
   - Monitor Conveyor Belt

3. System boundary:
   - The boundary of the system is the Conveyor Belt System itself, which includes the conveyor belt, the three stations, and the five sensors.

4. Relationships among actors:
   - The User interacts with the Conveyor Belt System through the three stations.
   - The Sensors are part of the Conveyor Belt System and provide input to the system.

For each use case:

Use case: Start Conveyor Belt
- Brief Description: The user starts the conveyor belt, which moves at a speed of 2 meters per second.
- Event Flow:
  - Basic Flow: The user sends a start command to the conveyor belt system. The system starts the conveyor belt.
  - Alternative Flow: If a sensor detects an object on the conveyor belt, the system stops the conveyor belt.
- Use Case Scenario: The user starts the conveyor belt. The conveyor belt moves at a speed of 2 meters per second. If a sensor detects an object on the conveyor belt, the system stops the conveyor belt.
- Special Requirements: The system must be able to start and stop the conveyor belt based on user commands and sensor input.
- Preconditions: The conveyor belt is not moving.
- Postconditions: The conveyor belt is moving at a speed of 2 meters per second.

Use case: Stop Conveyor Belt
- Brief Description: The user stops the conveyor belt.
- Event Flow:
  - Basic Flow: The user sends a stop command to the conveyor belt system. The system stops the conveyor belt.
  - Alternative Flow: If a sensor detects an object on the conveyor belt, the system stops the conveyor belt.
- Use Case Scenario: The user stops the conveyor belt. If a sensor detects an object on the conveyor belt, the system stops the conveyor belt.
- Special Requirements: The system must be able to start and stop the conveyor belt based on user commands and sensor input.
- Preconditions: The conveyor belt is moving.
- Postconditions: The conveyor belt is not moving.

Use case: Monitor Conveyor Belt
- Brief Description: The sensors monitor the conveyor belt for objects.
- Event Flow:
  - Basic Flow: The sensors continuously monitor the conveyor belt for objects. If a sensor detects an object, it sends a signal to the system, which stops the conveyor belt.
- Use Case Scenario: The sensors continuously monitor the conveyor belt. If a sensor detects an object, the system stops the conveyor belt.
- Special Requirements: The sensors must be able to detect objects on the conveyor belt and send a signal to the system.
- Preconditions: The conveyor belt is moving.
- Postconditions: If a sensor detects an object on the conveyor belt, the system stops the conveyor belt.

The priority of the use cases is as follows:
1. Start Conveyor Belt
2. Stop Conveyor Belt
3. Monitor Conveyor Belt

The properties mentioned in the initial requirement, such as the speed of the conveyor belt and the number of sensors, are reflected in the use case design.
