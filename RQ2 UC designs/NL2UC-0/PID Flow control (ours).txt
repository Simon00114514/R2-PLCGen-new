Agent: Use case name: PID Feedback Flow Control for Chlorine Dosing

1. Actor:
- Process Operator (Primary Actor)
- System (Secondary Actor)

2. Use case:
- Manage Chlorine Dosing

3. System boundary:
- Chlorine dosing control interface

4. Relationships among actors:
- The Process Operator initiates the Manage Chlorine Dosing use case (Primary Actor).
- The System provides feedback and executes the PID control (Secondary Actor).

Brief Description:
This use case describes the process by which the system manages the chlorine dosing in a water treatment process using PID feedback flow control. The system aims to maintain a dosing rate of 3 ppm with a sampling rate of 100 milliseconds.

Event Flow:
Basic Flow:
Preconditions: The system is operational, and the sensors are functioning correctly.
1. The Process Operator starts the chlorine dosing process.
2. The system samples the water concentration at a rate of 100 milliseconds.
3. The system calculates the appropriate flow rate to achieve a 3 ppm dosing rate.
4. The system adjusts the flow rate based on the PID algorithm.
5. The system maintains the flow rate as long as the concentration is within the desired range.
Postconditions: The chlorine concentration is maintained at the desired level.

Alternative Flow A (Concentration Below Threshold):
Preconditions: The system detects that the chlorine concentration is below the threshold.
1. The system reduces the flow rate to increase the concentration.
Postconditions: The chlorine concentration returns to within the desired range.

Alternative Flow B (Concentration Above Threshold):
Preconditions: The system detects that the chlorine concentration is above the threshold.
1. The system increases the flow rate to decrease the concentration.
Postconditions: The chlorine concentration returns to within the desired range.

Use Case Scenario:
- Scenario 1: The system operates under normal conditions, maintaining the desired chlorine concentration.
- Scenario 2: The system encounters a low chlorine concentration and adjusts the flow rate accordingly.
- Scenario 3: The system encounters a high chlorine concentration and adjusts the flow rate accordingly.

Special Requirements:
- The system must perform reliably under varying water treatment conditions.
- The PID control must be responsive and accurate to maintain the dosing rate.
- The interface should be user-friendly for the Process Operator.

Preconditions:
- The system has been calibrated for the specific water treatment process.
- The sensors are calibrated and functioning correctly.

Postconditions:
- The chlorine dosing process is either ongoing, maintaining the desired concentration, or has been completed with the concentration within the specified range.

Priority:
- The priority of this use case is high, as it is critical to maintaining the correct chlorine concentration for the water treatment process.

Errors and Corrections:
- Any errors in sensor readings or PID calculations must be identified and corrected promptly to ensure the accuracy of the dosing process. An error handling mechanism should be in place to alert the Process Operator in case of sensor failure or other critical issues.
