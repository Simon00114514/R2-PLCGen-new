Agent: Use case name: Control Mixing Process

1. Actor:
- Operator: The user who interacts with the system to control the mixing process.

2. Use case:
- UC1: Adjust Mixture Ratio

3. System boundary:
- The system includes the software controlling the mixing process and the hardware components such as sensors and actuators.

4. Relationships among actors:
- There is no direct relationship between actors as there is only one actor, the Operator.

Use case specification for UC1: Adjust Mixture Ratio

Brief Description:
This use case allows the Operator to control the mixing process of two reactants to achieve and maintain a ratio of 100:1. The system will adjust the input rate of the mixture based on the current ratio detected by the sensors.

Event Flow:
Basic Flow:
- Preconditions: The system is operational, and the sensors and actuators are functioning correctly.
- The Operator starts the mixing process.
- The system continuously monitors the ratio of the reactants.
- If the ratio is within the acceptable range (98 to 102), the system maintains the current input rate.
- Postconditions: The mixture is maintained at the desired ratio within the acceptable error margin.

Alternative Flow A (Ratio above 102):
- Preconditions: The system is operational, and the ratio detected is above 102.
- The system decreases the input rate of the reactants.
- Postconditions: The mixture ratio is adjusted to approach the target ratio of 100:1.

Alternative Flow B (Ratio below 98):
- Preconditions: The system is operational, and the ratio detected is below 98.
- The system increases the input rate of the reactants.
- Postconditions: The mixture ratio is adjusted to approach the target ratio of 100:1.

Use Case Scenario:
- Scenario 1: The Operator initiates the mixing process, and the system maintains the ratio without adjustments.
- Scenario 2: The Operator initiates the mixing process, and the system adjusts the input rate due to a ratio above 102.
- Scenario 3: The Operator initiates the mixing process, and the system adjusts the input rate due to a ratio below 98.

Special Requirements:
- The system must be able to process inputs without floating-point numbers, using multiplication to express ratios.
- The system should have a high reliability and performance to continuously monitor and adjust the mixing process.
- The system must be user-friendly to allow easy operation by the Operator.

Preconditions:
- The system is initialized and in a ready state.
- All sensors and actuators are calibrated and operational.

Postconditions:
- The mixing process is either ongoing with the correct ratio or has been adjusted to achieve the correct ratio.
- The system is ready for further adjustments or to be stopped by the Operator.

Priority:
- The priority of this use case is high, as it is essential for the core functionality of the system to maintain the correct mixture ratio.

Errors and Deficiencies:
- The requirement does not specify the behavior of the system in case of sensor or actuator failure, which should be addressed in the use case.
- The requirement does not detail the user interface or how the Operator will be informed of the current ratio or adjustments made, which should be included in the special requirements.

The properties mentioned in the initial requirement, such as the mixture ratio and the constraints on expressing floating-point numbers, have been reflected in the use case design.
