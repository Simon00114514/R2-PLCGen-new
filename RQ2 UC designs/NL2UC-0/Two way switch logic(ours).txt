Agent: 1. Use Case Name: Two-Way Switch Control

2. Actor:
   User: The person who operates the switches on the first and second floors.
   PLC: The Programmable Logic Controller that controls the light.

3. Use Case: Control of staircase light through two switches located on the first and second floors.

4. System Boundary: IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program

5. Relationships Among Actors: The user interacts with the PLC through the switches.

6. Detailed Descriptive Information for Each Use Case:
Use Case: Two-Way Switch Control
(1) Brief Description: The use case describes the operation of a two-way switch system where a user can control a light at the staircase from either the first or the second floor.
(2) Preconditions: The PLC is operational and the switches are in a known state (either on or off).
(3) Event Flow:
   Basic Flow: 
   1. The user presses the switch.
   2. The PLC receives the signal from the switch.
   3. The PLC changes the state of the light (if it's on, it turns off; if it's off, it turns on).
   Alternative Flow: None, as the operation is straightforward and does not have alternative flows.
(4) Postconditions: The light changes its state (from on to off, or from off to on).
(5) Use Case Scenario: A user is on the first floor and wants to go to the second floor. It's dark, so they press the switch on the first floor, which turns on the light. When they reach the second floor, they press the switch there, turning off the light.
(6) Special Requirements: The system must respond quickly to switch presses to ensure user safety. The PLC must be reliable and able to handle frequent state changes.

7. Priority of Use Cases: Two-Way Switch Control: High (as it's critical for user safety and convenience)

8. Data Requirements: 
[D-1]: The current state of the light (on or off)
[D-2]: The state of the switches (pressed or not pressed)

9. Business Rules (Optional): None.
