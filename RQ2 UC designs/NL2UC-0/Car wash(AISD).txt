  2: "User can view the status of the vehicle sensor (whether a vehicle is detected or not).",
  3: "User can view the status of the personnel sensor (whether a person is detected or not).",
  4: "User can view the current state of the car wash program (idle, in progress, stopped, alerting).",
  5: "User can receive an immediate program stop and an alert if the personnel sensor detects a person during the car wash process.",
  6: "User can reset the alert and restart the car wash program after ensuring the area is clear of persons.",
  7: "User can view a history log of car wash sessions including any incidents where the program was stopped due to personnel detection."
