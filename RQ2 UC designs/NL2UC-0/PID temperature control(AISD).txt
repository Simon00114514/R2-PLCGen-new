Given the task of creating a standalone IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) program for PID feedback control of internal temperature in a gas turbine, with the provision of a setpoint for the inlet valve position, here are the use cases that should be considered:

{ 1: User can input the desired temperature setpoint. }
{ 2: User can input PID control parameters (Proportional, Integral, Derivative gains). }
{ 3: System reads the current internal temperature of the gas turbine. }
{ 4: System compares the current temperature with the temperature setpoint. }
{ 5: System calculates the error between the setpoint and the current temperature. }
{ 6: System applies the PID algorithm to compute the required adjustment to the valve position. }
{ 7: If the temperature is below the threshold, the system increases the valve opening. }
{ 8: If the temperature is above the threshold, the system decreases the valve opening. }
{ 9: System outputs the new valve position to adjust the internal temperature. }
{ 10: System monitors the temperature change and iteratively adjusts the valve position to maintain the temperature at the setpoint. }
{ 11: User can view the current temperature and valve position in real-time. }
{ 12: User can manually override the automatic PID control if necessary. }
{ 13: System provides alarms or notifications if the temperature deviates significantly from the setpoint or if system errors occur. }
{ 14: User can access historical data on temperature and valve positions for analysis and optimization of the PID control parameters. }
{ 15: System ensures safety constraints are met to prevent damage to the gas turbine due to incorrect valve positions. }

These use cases outline the interactions between the user and the system, as well as the system's internal processes to maintain the desired temperature within the gas turbine using PID feedback control.
