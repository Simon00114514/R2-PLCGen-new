Agent: Use case name: PID Temperature Control for Gas Turbine

1. Actor:
- Control Engineer (Primary Actor)
- Gas Turbine System (Supporting Actor)

2. Use case:
- Manage Temperature Control

3. System boundary:
- The boundary includes the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program and the interface through which the Control Engineer interacts with the Gas Turbine System.

4. Relationships among actors:
- The Control Engineer (Primary Actor) uses the IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program (Supporting Actor) to manage the PID feedback control.
- Inclusion: The Gas Turbine System may include other use cases such as 'Monitor System Status' or 'Adjust Operational Parameters'.
- Extension: An 'Emergency Shutdown' use case could extend the 'Manage Temperature Control' use case if a critical system error occurs.
- Generalization: Not applicable in this context.

Specification for the use case 'Manage Temperature Control':

（1）Brief Description:
The 'Manage Temperature Control' use case enables the Control Engineer to maintain the internal temperature of the gas turbine within a specified range by adjusting the inlet valve opening based on PID feedback control.

（2）Event Flow:
Basic Flow Preconditions: The gas turbine is operational, and the Control Engineer has access to the control system.
Basic Flow Postconditions: The gas turbine temperature is maintained within the desired threshold, and the inlet valve opening is adjusted accordingly.

Alternative Flow Preconditions: The gas turbine temperature deviates significantly from the desired threshold.
Alternative Flow Postconditions: Additional measures are taken to bring the temperature back within the desired range, which may include manual intervention or emergency procedures.

（3）Use Case Scenario:
Scenario 1: The temperature is below the threshold, and the system automatically increases the valve opening.
Scenario 2: The temperature is above the threshold, and the system automatically decreases the valve opening.
Scenario 3: The temperature fluctuates rapidly, requiring manual intervention for stabilization.

（4）Special Requirements:
- The system must respond to temperature changes within a specific time frame to prevent damage to the turbine.
- The PID control algorithm must be robust and capable of handling various operational scenarios.
- The system should log all adjustments and interventions for audit and maintenance purposes.

（5）Preconditions:
- The IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program for PID control is correctly installed and configured.
- The temperature sensors are calibrated and functioning correctly.
- The Control Engineer is trained and authorized to manage the temperature control system.

（6）Postconditions:
- The gas turbine operates within the safe temperature range.
- The inlet valve opening is set to the appropriate level to maintain the desired temperature.
- Any adjustments made are recorded in the system log.

Priority Arrangement:
The priority of the use case 'Manage Temperature Control' is high, as it is critical for the safe and efficient operation of the gas turbine. Any deviations from the expected temperature range must be addressed promptly to prevent damage to the equipment and ensure operational continuity.
