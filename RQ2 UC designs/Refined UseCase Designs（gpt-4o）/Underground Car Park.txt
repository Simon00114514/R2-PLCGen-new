### Revised Use Case Design

#### Use Case Name: Underground Parking Entrance/Exit Control

1. **Actor**: PLC Program

2. **Use Case**: Control of Underground Parking Entrance/Exit

3. **System Boundary**: The system includes sensors (X1, X2), intermediate variables (M1, M2, M3, M4, M20, M30), and output devices (Y1, Y2).

4. **Relationships**: The PLC program interacts with sensors, intermediate variables, and output devices to control the traffic lights at the entrance/exit of the underground parking lot.

5. **Brief Description**: The PLC program controls the traffic lights at the entrance/exit of the underground parking lot according to the IEC 61131-3 standard. The program responds to sensor signals and changes the state of the traffic lights accordingly.

6. **Event Flow**:

   - **Basic Flow**:
     - **Preconditions**: Traffic lights are initially set to green.
     - **Events**:
       1. A car enters the passage from the ground floor, triggering sensor X1.
       2. The PLC program responds by turning on the red lights (Y1) at both the ground floor and basement entrances/exits, and turning off the green lights (Y2).
       3. The car leaves the entrance and enters the basement, triggering sensor X2.
       4. The PLC program responds by turning off the red lights and turning on the green lights (fulfilling original requirement 2).
     - **Postconditions**: Traffic lights return to their initial state (green).

   - **Alternative Flow**:
     - **Preconditions**: Traffic lights are initially set to green.
     - **Events**:
       1. A car leaves the basement and enters the exit, triggering sensor X2.
       2. The PLC program responds by turning on the red lights at both the ground floor and basement entrances/exits, and turning off the green lights.
       3. The car leaves the exit and reaches the ground floor, triggering sensor X1.
       4. The PLC program responds by turning off the red lights and turning on the green lights (fulfilling original requirement 4).
     - **Postconditions**: Traffic lights return to their initial state (green).

7. **Exception Flow**:
   - **Sensor Failure**: If a sensor fails to trigger correctly, the system will maintain the current light state and issue an alert.

8. **Special Requirements**: The PLC program must comply with the IEC 61131-3 standard.

9. **Priority**: High (Critical for the operation of the underground parking lot)

10. **Intermediate Variables**:
    - M20: Activated when a car enters the passage from the ground floor.
    - M30: Activated when a car enters the passage from the basement.

### Revised CTL/LTL Specifications

1. **Basic Flow State Change**:
   - CTL: `AG((X1) -> AX(Y1 & ! Y2 & M20))`
   - LTL: `G((X1) -> X(Y1 & !Y2 & M20))`

2. **Alternative Flow State Change**:
   - CTL: `AG((X2) -> AX(Y1 & !Y2 & M30))`
   - LTL: `G((X2) -> X(Y1 & !Y2 & M30))`

3. **Activation of Intermediate Variables**:
   - CTL: `AG((X1) -> AX(M20)) & AG((X2) -> AX(M30))`
   - LTL: `G((X1) -> X(M20)) & G((X2) -> X(M30))`

4. **Green Light Restoration Conditions**:
   - CTL: `AG((X2 & M20) -> AX(! Y1 & Y2))`  // After the car enters the basement
   - LTL: `G((X2 & M20) -> X(! Y1 & Y2))`
   - CTL: `AG((X1 & M30) -> AX(! Y1 & Y2))`  // After the car leaves the parking lot
   - LTL: `G((X1 & M30) -> X(! Y1 & Y2))`

5. **Exception Handling**:
   - CTL: `AG((! X1 & ! X2) -> AX(Y2 & ! Y1))`
   - LTL: `G((! X1 & ! X2) -> X(Y2 & ! Y1))`

6. **Forbidden State**:
   - CTL: `AG(!(Y1 & Y2))`
   - LTL: `G(!Y1 & Y2))`

7. **Reachability**:
   - CTL: `EF(Y1 & !Y2)`
   - LTL: `F(Y1 & !Y2)`

8. **Repeatability**:
   - CTL: `AG(EF(Y1 & !Y2))`
   - LTL: `G(F(Y1 & !Y2))`

This revised design and specification ensure that the original requirements, particularly regarding the restoration of green lights, are fully addressed.
