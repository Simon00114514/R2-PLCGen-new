1. Use Case Name: Conveyor Belt Speed Adjustment

2. Actor:
   - Sensor: Detects the load on the conveyor belt.
   - Control System: Adjusts the speed of the conveyor belt based on the sensor's data.

3. Use Case: Adjust Conveyor Belt Speed

4. System Boundary: IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program

5. Relationships Among Actors: The sensor detects the load and sends the data to the control system. The control system adjusts the speed of the conveyor belt based on the sensor's data.

6. Detailed Descriptive Information for Each Use Case:

Use Case: Adjust Conveyor Belt Speed

(1) Brief Description: The control system adjusts the speed of the conveyor belt based on the load detected by the sensor.

(2) Preconditions: The sensor is operational and able to detect the load on the conveyor belt.

(3) Event Flow:

Basic Flow:
- The sensor detects the load on the conveyor belt.
- The sensor sends the load data to the control system.
- The control system adjusts the speed of the conveyor belt based on the load data.

Alternative Flow:
- If the load exceeds the threshold, the control system reduces the speed of the conveyor belt.
- If the load is below the threshold, the control system increases the speed of the conveyor belt.
- If the load is within the acceptable range, the control system maintains the current speed of the conveyor belt.

(4) Postconditions: The speed of the conveyor belt is adjusted based on the load.

(5) Use Case Scenario: A heavy load is detected on the conveyor belt. The sensor sends this data to the control system, which then reduces the speed of the conveyor belt to accommodate the heavy load.

(6) Special Requirements: The system must be able to adjust the speed of the conveyor belt quickly and accurately based on the load data from the sensor.

7. Priority of Use Cases: Adjust Conveyor Belt Speed - High

8. Data Requirements: Load data from the sensor.

9. Business Rules: The speed of the conveyor belt should be adjusted within a safe range to prevent damage to the conveyor belt or the load.
