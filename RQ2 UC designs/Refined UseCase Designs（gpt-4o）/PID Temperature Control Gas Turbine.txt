**1. Use Case Name:**
   - Temperature Control

**2. Actor:**
   - Gas Turbine: The component that requires temperature control.
   - PID Controller: The component that controls the temperature of the gas turbine.

**3. Use Case:**
   - Temperature Control: The PID controller adjusts the opening of the inlet valve to control the internal temperature of the gas turbine.

**4. System Boundary:**
   - IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program
   - System Boundary Clarification: The system includes the PID controller and the gas turbine's inlet valve control mechanism. External elements include temperature sensors and the gas turbine itself.

**5. Relationships Among Actors:**
   - The PID Controller interacts with the Gas Turbine to control its temperature.

**6. Detailed Descriptive Information for Each Use Case:**

   **Use Case: Temperature Control**

   (1) **Brief Description:**
       - The PID controller adjusts the opening of the inlet valve to control the internal temperature of the gas turbine.

   (2) **Preconditions:**
       - The gas turbine is operational.
       - The PID controller is active.
       - Temperature sensors are functioning correctly.

   (3) **Event Flow:**

   **Basic Flow:**
   1. The PID controller reads the current temperature of the gas turbine from the sensors.
   2. If the temperature is below the threshold, the PID controller increases the opening of the inlet valve.
   3. If the temperature is above the threshold, the PID controller decreases the opening of the inlet valve.

   **Alternative Flow:**
   1. If the temperature is within the acceptable range, the PID controller maintains the current opening of the inlet valve.

   **Exception Flow:**
   1. If the temperature sensor fails, the system triggers an alert and switches to a safe mode, maintaining the current valve position until manual intervention.
   2. If the PID controller fails, the system triggers an alert and the inlet valve is set to a predefined safe position.

   (4) **Postconditions:**
       - The temperature of the gas turbine is controlled within the acceptable range.

   (5) **Use Case Scenario:**
       - In a scenario where the gas turbine's temperature is above the threshold, the PID controller will decrease the opening of the inlet valve to lower the temperature.

   (6) **Special Requirements:**
       - The system must be able to accurately read the temperature of the gas turbine and adjust the opening of the inlet valve accordingly.
       - The system should handle sensor and controller failures gracefully.

**7. Priority of Use Cases:**
   - Temperature Control: High

**8. Data Requirements:**
   - D-1: Current temperature of the gas turbine (sourced from temperature sensors)
   - D-2: Threshold temperature for the gas turbine
   - D-3: Current opening of the inlet valve

**9. Business Rules (Optional):**
   - B-1: The PID controller must not allow the temperature of the gas turbine to exceed the threshold.
   - B-2: The PID controller must adjust the opening of the inlet valve based on the current temperature of the gas turbine.
